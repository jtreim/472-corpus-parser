The Origin of the Spirit of Lightning








Tung Wang Kung, the King of the Immortals, was playing at pitch-pot
 with Yue Nue. He lost; whereupon Heaven smiled, and from its
half-open mouth a ray of light came out. This was lightning; it is
regarded as feminine because it is supposed to come from the earth,
which is of the _yin_, or female, principle.
