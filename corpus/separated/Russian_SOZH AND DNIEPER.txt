SOZH AND DNIEPER



  There was once a blind old man called Dvina. He had
  two sons--the elder called Sozh, and the younger Dnieper.
  Sozh was of a boisterous turn, and went roving about the forests,
  the hills, and the plains; but Dnieper was remarkably
  sweet-tempered, and he spent all his time at home, and was his
  mother's favorite. Once, when Sozh was away from home, the
  old father was deceived by his wife into giving the elder son's
  blessing to the younger son. Thus spake Dvina while blessing
  him:--

  "Dissolve, my son, into a wide and deep river. Flow past
  towns, and bathe villages without number as far as the blue sea.
  Thy brother shall be thy servant. Be rich and prosperous to
  the end of time!"

  Dnieper turned into a river, and flowed through fertile meadows
  and dreamy woods. But after three days, Sozh returned
  home and began to complain.

  "If thou dost desire to become superior to thy brother,"
  said his father, "speed swiftly by hidden ways, through dark
  untrodden forests, and if thou canst outstrip thy brother, he will
  have to be thy servant!"

  Away sped Sozh on the chase, through untrodden places,
  washing away swamps, cutting out gullies, tearing up oaks by
  the roots. The Vulture told Dnieper of this, and he put on
  extra speed, tearing his way through high hills rather than turn
  on one side. Meanwhile Sozh persuaded the Raven to fly
  straight to Dnieper, and, as soon as it had come up with him
  to croak three times; he himself was to burrow under the earth,
  intending to leap to the surface at the cry of the Raven, and by
  that means to get before his brother. But the Vulture fell on
  the Raven; the Raven began to croak before it had caught up
  the river Dnieper. Up burst Sozh from underground, and fell
  straight into the waves of the Dnieper.
