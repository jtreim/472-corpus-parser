Myths of Time








T'ai Sui is the celestial spirit who presides over the year. He
is the President of the Ministry of Time. This god is much to
be feared. Whoever offends against him is sure to be destroyed. He
strikes when least expected to. T'ai Sui is also the Ministry itself,
whose members, numbering a hundred and twenty, are set over time,
years, months, and days. The conception is held by some writers to
be of Chaldeo-Assyrian origin.

The god T'ai Sui is not mentioned in the T'ang and Sung rituals, but in
the Yuean dynasty (A.D. 1280-1368) sacrifices were offered to him in the
College of the Grand Historiographer whenever any work of importance
was about to be undertaken. Under this dynasty the sacrifices were
offered to T'ai Sui and to the ruling gods of the months and of the
days. But these sacrifices were not offered at regular times: it
was only at the beginning of the Ch'ing (Manchu) dynasty (1644-1912)
that it was decided to offer the sacrifices at fixed periods.
