The Demons of Blackwater River








One day the Master suddenly exclaimed: "What is that noise?" Sun
replied: "You are afraid; you have forgotten the Heart Prayer,
according to which we are to be indifferent to all the calls of the
six senses--the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind. These are the Six
Thieves. If you cannot suppress them, how do you expect to see the
Great Lord?" The Master thought a while and then said: "O disciple,
when shall we see the Incarnate Model (Ju Lai) face to face?"

Pa-chieh said: "If we are to meet such demons as these, it will take
us a thousand years to get to the West." But Sha Ho-shang rejoined:
"Both you and I are stupid; if we persevere and travel on, shoulder
to shoulder, we shall reach there at last." While thus talking,
they saw before them a dark river in flood, which the horse could not
cross. Seeing a small boat, the Master said: "Let us engage that boat
to take us across." While crossing the river in it, they discovered
that it was a boat sent by the Demon of Blackwater River to entrap
them in midstream, and the Master would have been slain had not Sun
and the Western Dragon come to the rescue.
