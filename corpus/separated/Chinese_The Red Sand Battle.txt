The Red Sand Battle








The fight began with a challenge from the Ancient Immortal of the
South Pole to Chang Shao. The latter, riding his deer, dashed into
the fray, and aimed a terrific blow with his sword at Hsien-weng's
head, but White Crane Youth warded it off with his Three-precious Jade
Sceptre. Chang then produced a two-edged sword and renewed the attack,
but, being disarmed, dismounted from his deer and threw several
handfuls of hot sand at Hsien-weng. The latter, however, easily
fanned them away with his Five-fire Seven-feathers Fan, rendering
them harmless. Chang then fetched a whole bushel of the hot sand and
scattered it over the enemy, but Hsien-weng counteracted the menace
by merely waving his fan. White Crane Youth struck Chang Shao with
his jade sceptre, knocking him off his horse, and then dispatched
him with his two-edged sword.

After this battle Wu Wang was found to be already dead. Jan Teng
on learning this ordered Lei Chen-tzu to take the corpse to Mount
P'eng and wash it. He then dissolved a pill in water and poured the
solution into Wu Wang's mouth, whereupon he revived and was escorted
back to his palace.
