                        RELEASING THE DEER


Ganisk'ide was the only one who owned deer. He was the only one who
brought them home and who ate their flesh. He gave none of the meat to
the people who lived near him.

Ravens, who were then people, proposed that they make a puppy and desert
it. They did this; they moved away and left a puppy lying there. When
the children of Ganisk'ide went where the people had moved away, they
found the puppy. They took it up and carried it home.

Ganisk'ide told the children to throw the puppy away, but when they
objected, he told them to try the dog's eyes by holding fire in front of
them. When they brought the fire near the dog's eyes it cried, “gai gai
gai.” “It is a real dog,” Ganisk'ide said. “You may take him behind the
stone door where the deer are enclosed and let him eat the entrails.”

When the children had taken the dog behind this door he became a man
again. He moved the stone to one side and the deer that were inside ran
out. Ganisk'ide called to his wife from the doorway to touch the
nostrils of the deer with her odorous secretions. She touched each of
the deer on the nose as they ran by her and they received the sense of
smell. They ran away from her.

“You said it was a dog,” he said to his children with whom he was angry,
“but he turned them out for us.” The deer scattered all over the earth.
