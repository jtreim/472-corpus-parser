ROBERT ROBERTS AND THE FAIRIES




Robert Roberts was a carpenter who worked hard and well; but he could
never keep his tongue still. One day, as he was crossing a brook, a
little man came up to him and said:

“Robert Roberts, go up to the holly tree that leans over the road on the
Red-hill, and dig below it, and you shall be rewarded.”

The very next morning, at daybreak, Robert Roberts set out for the spot,
and dug a great hole, before anyone was up, when he found a box of gold.
He went to the same place twice afterwards, and dug, and found gold
each time. But as he grew rich, he began to boast and hint that he had
mysterious friends. One day, when the talk turned on the fairies, he
said that he knew them right well, and that they gave him money. Robert
Roberts thought no more of the matter until he went to the spot a week
afterwards, one evening at dusk. When he got to the tree, and began to
dig as usual, big stones came rolling down the bank, just missing him,
so that he ran for his life, and never went near the place again.
