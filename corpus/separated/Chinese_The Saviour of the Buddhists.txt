The Saviour of the Buddhists








Inwardly Sun was glad that his fame had gone abroad. Returning to the
city, he met the two chief Taoists. They asked him if he had found
his relative. "Yes," he replied, "they are all my relatives!" They
smiled and said: "How is it that you have so many relatives?" Sun
said: "One hundred are my father's relatives, one hundred my mother's
relatives, and the remainder my adopted relatives. If you will let
all these priests depart with me, then I will enter the city with you;
otherwise I will not enter." "You must be mad to speak to us in this
way. The priests were given us by the King. If you had asked for a
few only, we might have consented, but your request is altogether
unreasonable." Sun then asked them three times if they would liberate
the priests. When they finally refused, he grew very angry, took his
magic spear from his ear and brandished it in the air, when all their
heads fell off and rolled on the ground.
