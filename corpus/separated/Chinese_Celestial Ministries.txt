Celestial Ministries








The dualistic idea, already referred to, of the Otherworld being
a replica of this one is nowhere more clearly illustrated than in
the celestial Ministries or official Bureaux or Boards, with their
chiefs and staffs functioning over the spiritual hierarchies. The Nine
Ministries up aloft doubtless had their origin in imitation of the Six,
Eight, or Nine Ministries or Boards which at various periods of history
have formed the executive part of the official hierarchy in China. But
their names are different and their functions do not coincide.

Generally, the functions of the officers of the celestial Boards are
to protect mankind from the evils represented in the title of the
Board, as, for example, thunder, smallpox, fire, etc. In all cases
the duties seem to be remedial. As the God of War was, as we saw, the
god who protects people from the evils of war, so the vast hierarchy
of these various divinities is conceived as functioning for the good
of mankind. Being too numerous for inclusion here, an account of them
is given under various headings in some of the following chapters.
