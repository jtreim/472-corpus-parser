The Return to China







The pilgrims having overcome the predicted eighty difficulties of
their outward journey, there remained only one to be overcome on the
homeward way.

They were now returning upon a cloud which had been placed at their
disposal, and which had been charged to bear them safely home. But
alas! the cloud broke and precipitated them to the earth by the side
of a wide river which they must cross. There were no ferry-boats or
rafts to be seen, so they were glad to avail themselves of the kind
offices of a turtle, who offered to take them across on his back. But
in midstream the turtle reminded Hsuean Chuang of a promise he had made
him when on his outward journey, namely, that he would intercede for
him before the Ruler of the West, and ask his Majesty to forgive all
past offences and allow him to resume his humanity again. The turtle
asked him if he had remembered to keep his word. Hsuean Chuang replied:
"I remember our conversation, but I am sorry to say that under great
pressure I quite forgot to keep my promise." "Then," said the turtle,
"you are at liberty to dispense with my services." He then disappeared
beneath the water, leaving the pilgrims floundering in the stream with
their precious books. They swam the river, and with great difficulty
managed to save a number of volumes, which they dried in the sun.
