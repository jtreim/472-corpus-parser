Help from Ju Lai








The Ancient of Days mounted a cloud and went with Sun to the cave. When
the Demon saw who had come he was terrified. The Ancient of Days then
recited an incantation, and the Demon surrendered the magic coil
to him. On the recitation of a second incantation all his strength
left him, and he appeared as a bull, and was led away by a ring in
his nose. The Master and his disciples were then set at liberty,
and proceeded on their journey.
