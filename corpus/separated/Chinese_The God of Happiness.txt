The God of Happiness








The God of Happiness, Fu Shen, owes his origin to the predilection
of the Emperor Wu Ti (A.D. 502-50) of the Liang dynasty for dwarfs as
servants and comedians in his palace. The number levied from the Tao
Chou district in Hunan became greater and greater, until it seriously
prejudiced the ties of family relations. When Yang Ch'eng, _alias_
Yang Hsi-chi, was Criminal Judge of Tao Chou he represented to the
Emperor that, according to law, the dwarfs were his subjects but not
his slaves. Being touched by this remark, the Emperor ordered the
levy to be stopped.

Overjoyed at their liberation from this hardship, the people
of that district set up images of Yang and offered sacrifices to
him. Everywhere he was venerated as the Spirit of Happiness. It was in
this simple way that there came into being a god whose portraits and
images abound everywhere throughout the country, and who is worshipped
almost as universally as the God of Riches himself.

Another person who attained to the dignity of God of Happiness (known
as Tseng-fu Hsiang-kung, 'the Young Gentleman who Increases Happiness')
was Li Kuei-tsu, the minister of Emperor Wen Ti of the Wei dynasty,
the son of the famous Ts'ao Ts'ao, but in modern times the honour
seems to have passed to Kuo Tzu-i. He was the saviour of the T'ang
dynasty from the depredations of the Turfans in the reign of the
Emperor Hsuean Tsung. He lived A.D. 697-781, was a native of Hua Chou,
in Shensi, and one of the most illustrious of Chinese generals. He
is very often represented in pictures clothed in blue official robes,
leading his small son Kuo Ai to Court.
