Chiang Tzu-ya defeats Wen Chung








After this Lao Tzu rallied many of the skilful spirits to help Chiang
Tzu-ya in his battle with Wen Chung, providing them with the Ancient
Immortal of the South Pole's Sand-blaster and an earth-conquering light
which enabled them to travel a thousand _li_ in a day. From the hot
sand used the contest became known as the Red Sand Battle. Jan Teng,
on P'eng-lai Mountain, in consultation with Tzu-ya, also arranged
the plan of battle.
