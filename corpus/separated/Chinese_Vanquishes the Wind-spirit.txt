Vanquishes the Wind-spirit








At this time terrible calamities began to lay waste the land. Ten
suns appeared in the sky, the heat of which burnt up all the crops;
dreadful storms uprooted trees and overturned houses; floods overspread
the country. Near the Tung-t'ing Lake a serpent, a thousand feet long,
devoured human beings, and wild boars of enormous size did great
damage in the eastern part of the kingdom. Yao ordered Shen I to go
and slay the devils and monsters who were causing all this mischief,
placing three hundred men at his service for that purpose.

Shen I took up his post on Mount Ch'ing Ch'iu to study the cause of the
devastating storms, and found that these tempests were released by Fei
Lien, the Spirit of the Wind, who blew them out of a sack. As we shall
see when considering the thunder myths, the ensuing conflict ended
in Fei Lien suing for mercy and swearing friendship to his victor,
whereupon the storms ceased.
