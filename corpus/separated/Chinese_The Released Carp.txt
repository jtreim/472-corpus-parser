The Released Carp








Before his departure he noticed a fisherman holding in his hand a fine
carp; this he bought for a small sum to give to his mother. Suddenly
he noticed that the fish had a very extraordinary look, and, changing
his mind, he let it go in the waters of the Hung Chiang, afterward
telling his mother what he had done. She congratulated him on his
action, and assured him that the good deed would not go unrewarded.
