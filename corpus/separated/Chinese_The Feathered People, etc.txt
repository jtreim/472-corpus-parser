The Feathered People, etc








The Feathered People are very tall, and are covered with fluffy
down. They have wings in place of arms, and can fly short distances. On
the points of the wings are claws, which serve as hands. Their
noses are like beaks. Gentle and timid, they do not leave their own
country. They have good voices, and like to sing ballads. If one
wishes to visit this people he must go far to the south-east and then
inquire. There is also the Land of the People with Three Faces, who
live in the centre of the Great Waste and never die; the Land of the
Three-heads, east of the K'un-lun Mountains; the Three-body Country,
the inhabitants of which have one head with three bodies, three arms
and but two legs; and yet another where the people have square heads,
broad shoulders, and three legs, and the stones on the land are all
gold and jade.
