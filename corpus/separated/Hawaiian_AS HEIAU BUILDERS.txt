AS HEIAU BUILDERS


The Menehunes are credited with the construction of numerous _heiaus_
(ancient temples) in various parts of the islands.

The heiau of Mookini, near Honoipu, Kohala, is pointed out as an
instance of their marvellous work. The place selected for the site
of the temple was on a grassy plain. The stones in the nearest
neighborhood were for some reason not deemed suitable for the
work, so those of Pololu Valley, distant some twelve miles, were
selected. Tradition says the Menehunes were placed in a line covering
the entire distance from Pololu to Honoipu, whereby the stones were
passed from hand to hand for the entire work. Work was begun at the
quiet of night, and at cock-crow in the morning it was finished. Thus
in one night the heiau of Mookini was built.

Another temple of their erection was at Pepeekeo, Hilo, the peculiarity
of the work being that the stones had been brought together by the
residents of that part of the district, by direction of the chief, but
that in one night, the Menehunes gathered together and built it. The
chief and his people were surprised on coming the next morning to
resume their labors, to find the heiau completed.

There stands on the pali of Waikolu, near Kalaupapa, Molokai,
a heiau that Hawaiians believe to have been constructed by no one
else than the Menehunes. It is on the top of a ledge in the face of
a perpendicular cliff, with a continuous inaccessible cliff behind it
reaching hundreds of feet above. No one has ever been able to reach it
either from above or from below; and the marvel is how the material,
which appears to be seashore stones, was put in place.
