Apotheosized Philosophers








The philosophers Lieh Tzu, Huai-nan Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Mo Tzu, etc.,
have also been apotheosized. Nothing very remarkable is related
of them. Most of them had several reincarnations and possessed
supernatural powers. The second, who was a king, when taken by
the Eight Immortals to the genii's Heaven forgot now and then to
address them as superiors, and but for their intercession with
Yue Ti, the Pearly Emperor, would have been reincarnated. In order
to humiliate himself, he thereafter called himself Huai-nan Tzu,
'the Sage of the South of the Huai.' The third, Chuang Tzu, Chuang
Sheng, or Chuang Chou, was a disciple of Lao Tzu. Chuang Tzu was in
the habit of sleeping during the day, and at night would transform
himself into a butterfly, which fluttered gaily over the flowers in
the garden. On waking, he would still feel the sensation of flying in
his shoulders. On asking Lao Tzu the reason for this, he was told:
"Formerly you were a white butterfly which, having partaken of the
quintessence of flowers and of the _yin_ and the _yang_, should have
been immortalized; but one day you stole some peaches and flowers in
Wang Mu Niang-niang's garden. The guardian of the garden slew you,
and that is how you came to be reincarnated." At this time he was
fifty years of age.
