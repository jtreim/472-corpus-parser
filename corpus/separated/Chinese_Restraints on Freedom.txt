Restraints on Freedom








Sun went to look for his uncle. Hearing this, many Buddhist priests
surrounded him, hoping to be recognized as his lost relative. After
a while he smiled. They asked him the reason. He said: "Why do you
make no progress? Life is not meant for idleness." They said: "We
cannot do anything. We are terribly oppressed." "What power have your
masters?" "By using their magic they can call up wind or rain." "That
is a small matter," said Sun. "What else can they do?" "They can make
the pills of immortality, and change stone into gold."

Sun said: "These are also small matters; many can do the same. How did
these Taoists deceive your King?" "The King attends their prayers night
and day, expecting thereby to attain to immortality." "Why do you not
leave the place?" "It is impossible, for the King has ordered pictures
of us to be hung up everywhere. In all the numerous prefectures,
magistracies, and market-places in Slow-carts Country are pictures of
the Buddhist priests, and any official who catches a runaway priest
is promoted three degrees, while every non-official receives fifty
taels. The proclamation is signed by the King. So you see we are
helpless." Sun then said: "You might as well die and end it all."
