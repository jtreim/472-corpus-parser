THE CONQUEST OF FATE




In the Dakshinadesa there lived a Brahmin boy who from his childhood
was given a very liberal education in Sanskrit. He had read so much
in philosophy that before he reached the sixteenth year of his life
he began to despise the pleasures of the world. Everything which he
saw was an illusion (mithya) to him. So he resolved to renounce the
world and to go to a forest, there to meet with some great sage,
and pass his days with him in peace and happiness.

Having thus made up his mind, he left his home one day without the
knowledge of his parents and travelled towards the Dandakaranya. After
wandering for a long time in that impenetrable forest, and undergoing
all the miseries of a wood inhabited only by wild beasts, he reached
the banks of the Tungabhadra. His sufferings in his wanderings in a
forest untrodden by human feet, his loneliness in the midst of wild
beasts, his fears whether after all he had not failed in his search
for consolation in a preceptor to teach him the higher branches of
philosophy, came up one after another before his mind. Dejected and
weary, he cast his glance forward as far as it could reach. Was it
a reality or only imagination? He saw before him a lonely cottage
of leaves (parnasala). To a lonely traveller even the appearance of
shelter is welcome, so he followed up his vision till it became a
reality, and an aged hoary Brahmin, full fourscore and more in years,
welcomed our young philosopher.

"What has brought you here, my child, to this lonely forest thus
alone?" spoke in a sweet voice the hoary lord of the cottage of leaves.

"A thirst for knowledge, so that I may acquire the mastery over the
higher branches of philosophy," was the reply of our young adventurer,
whose name was Subrahmanya.

"Sit down my child," said the old sage, much pleased that in this
Kaliyuga, which is one long epoch of sin, there was at least one
young lad who had forsaken his home for philosophy.

Having thus seen our hero safely relieved from falling a prey to the
tigers and lions of the Dandakaranya, let us enquire into the story
of the old sage. In the good old days even of this Kaliyuga learned
people, after fully enjoying the world, retired to the forests,
with or without their wives, to pass the decline of life in solemn
solitude and contemplation. When they went with their wives they were
said to undergo the vanaprastha stage of family life.

The hoary sage of our story was undergoing vanaprastha, for he was
in the woods with his wife. His name while living was Jñananidhi. He
had built a neat parnasala, or cottage of leaves, on the banks of
the commingled waters of the Tunga and Bhadra, and here his days and
nights were spent in meditation. Though old in years he retained the
full vigour of manhood, the result of a well-spent youth. The life
of his later years was most simple and sinless.

        "Remote from man, with God he passed his days;
        Prayer all his business, all his pleasures praise."

The wood yielded him herbs, fruits, and roots, and the river,
proverbial 
                "But from the mountain's grassy side
                    A guiltless feast I bring;
                A bag with herbs and fruits supplied,
                    And water from the spring."

His faithful wife brought him these, while Jñananidhi himself devoted
his whole time to the contemplation of God.

Such was Jñananidhi--the abode of all wise people--to whom the
boy-philosopher, Subrahmanya, resorted. After questioning each other
both were mightily pleased at the fortune which had brought them
together. Jñananidhi was glad to impart his hard-earned knowledge
during his leisure moments to the young student, and Subrahmanya,
with that longing which made him renounce the city and take to the
woods eagerly swallowed and assimilated whatever was administered to
him. He relieved his mother--for as such he regarded his master's
wife--of all her troubles, and used, himself, to go out to bring
the fruits, herbs, and roots necessary for the repasts of the little
family. Thus passed five years, by which time our young friend had
become learned in the many branches of Aryan philosophy.

Jñananidhi had a desire to visit the source of the Tungabhadra, but
his wife was eight months advanced in her pregnancy. So he could not
take her; and to take care of her he had to leave behind his disciple,
Subrahmanya. Thus after commending the lady to Subrahmanya's care,
and leaving for female assistance another sage's wife, whom he had
brought from a distant forest, Jñananidhi went his way.

Now, there is a strong belief among Hindus that Brahma, the great
creator, writes on everyone's head at the time of his birth his
future fortunes in life. He is supposed to do this just at the
moment of birth. Of course, the great god when he enters the room
to discharge his onerous duty, is invisible to all human eyes. But
the eyes of Subrahmanya were not exactly human. The supreme knowledge
which Jñananidhi had imparted to him made it easy for him to discern at
once a person entering most impolitely the room in which his master's
wife had been confined.

"Let your reverence stop here," said the disciple angrily though
respectfully.

The great god shuddered, for he had been in the habit of entering
hourly innumerable buildings on his eternal rounds of duty, but never
till then had a human being perceived him and asked him to stop. His
wonder knew no measure, and as he stood bewildered the following
reprimand fell on his ears:

"Hoary Brahmin sage (for so Brahma appeared), it is unbecoming your age
thus to enter the hut of my master, unallowed by me, who am watching
here. My teacher's wife is ill. Stop!"

Brahma hastily--for the time of inscribing the future fortune on the
forehead of the baby to be born was fast approaching--explained to
Subrahmanya who he was and what had brought him there. As soon as
our young hero came to know the person who stood before him he rose
up, and, tying his upper cloth round his hips as a mark of respect,
went round the creator thrice, fell down before Brahma's most holy
feet and begged his pardon. Brahma had not much time. He wanted to
go in at once, but our young friend would not leave the god until he
explained what he meant to write on the head of the child.

"My son!" said Brahma, "I myself do not know what my iron nail will
write on the head of the child. When the child is born I place the
nail on its head, and the instrument writes the fate of the baby in
proportion to its good or bad acts in its former life. To delay me
is merely wrong. Let me go in."

"Then," said Subrahmanya, "your holiness must inform me when your
holiness goes out what has been written on the child's head."

"Agreed," said Brahma and went in. After a moment he returned, and
our young hero at the door asked the god what his nail had written.

"My child!" said Brahma, "I will inform you what it wrote; but if you
disclose it to anyone your head will split into a thousand pieces. The
child is a male child. It has before it a very hard life. A buffalo and
a sack of grain will be its livelihood. What is to be done. Perhaps
it had not done any good acts in its former life, and as the result
of its sin it must undergo miseries now."

"What! Your supreme holiness, the father of this child is a great
sage! And is this the fate reserved to the son of a sage?" wept the
true disciple of the sage.

"What have I to do with the matter? The fruits of acts in a former
life must be undergone in the present life. But, remember, if you
should reveal this news to any one your head will split into a
thousand pieces."

Having said this Brahma went away, leaving Subrahmanya extremely pained
to hear that the son of a great sage was to have a hard life. He could
not even open his lips on the subject, for if he did his head would be
split. In sorrow he passed some days, when Jñananidhi returned from
his pilgrimage and was delighted to see his wife and the child doing
well, and in the learned company of the old sage our young disciple
forgot all his sorrow.

Three more years passed away in deep study, and again the old
sage wanted to go on a pilgrimage to the sacred source of the
Tungabhadra. Again was his wife expecting her confinement, and he
had to leave her and his disciple behind with the usual temporary
female assistance. Again, too, did Brahma come at the moment of birth,
but found easy admittance as Subrahmanya had now become acquainted
with him owing to the previous event. Again did Brahma take an oath
from him not to communicate the fortunes of the second child, with
the curse that if he broke his oath, his head would split into a
thousand pieces. This child was a female, and the nail had written
that her fate was to be that of a frivolous woman. Extremely vexed
was our young philosopher. The thought vexed him to such a degree,
that language has no words to express it. After worrying a great deal
he consoled himself with the soothing philosophies of the fatalists,
that fate alone governs the world.

The old sage in due course returned, and our young disciple spent
two more happy years with him. After a little more than ten years
had been thus spent the boy reached to five years and the girl to
two. The more they advanced in years the more did the recollection
of their future pain Subrahmanya. So one morning he humbly requested
the old sage to permit him to go on a long journey to the Himalayas
and other mountains, and Jñananidhi, knowing that all that he knew
had been grasped by the young disciple, permitted him with a glad
heart to satisfy his curiosity.

Our hero started, and after several years, during which he visited
several towns and learned men, reached the Himalayas. There he saw
many sages, and lived with them for some time. He did not remain in
one place, for his object was more to examine the world. So he went
from place to place, and after a long and interesting journey of
twenty years he again returned to the banks of the Tungabhadra, at
the very place where he lived for ten years and imbibed philosophical
knowledge from Jñananidhi. But he saw there neither Jñananidhi nor his
old wife. They had long since fallen a prey to the lord of death. Much
afflicted at heart at seeing his master and mistress no more, he went
to the nearest town, and there after a deal of search he found a coolie
with a single buffalo. The fate which Brahma's nail had written on
his master's son rushed into the mind of Subrahmanya. He approached
the coolie, and, on closely examining him from a distance, our hero
found distinct indications of his master's face in the labourer. His
grief knew no bounds at seeing the son of a great sage thus earning
his livelihood by minding a buffalo. He followed him to his home,
and found that he had a wife and two children. One sack of corn he had
in his house and no more, from which he took out a portion every day
and gave it to his wife to be shelled. The rice was cooked, and with
the petty earnings of a coolie, he and his family kept body and soul
together. Each time the corn in the sack became exhausted he used to
be able to save enough to replenish it again with corn. Thus did he
(according to the writing of Brahma's nail) pass his days. Kapali
was the name of this coolie, the sage's son.

"Do you know me, Kapali?" said our hero, as he remembered his name.

The coolie was astonished to hear his name so readily pronounced by
one who was apparently a stranger to him, but he said:--

"I am sorry that I do not know you, Sir."

Subrahmanya then explained to him who he was, and requested him to
follow his advice.

"My dear son," said he, "do as I bid you. Early morning to-morrow leave
your bed and take to the market your buffalo and the corn sack. Dispose
of them for whatever amount they will fetch. Do not think twice about
the matter. Buy all that is necessary for a sumptuous meal from the
sale proceeds and eat it all up at once without reserving a morsel
for the morrow. You will get a great deal more than you can eat in a
day; but do not reserve any, even the smallest portion of it. Feed
several other Brahmins with it. Do not think that I advise you for
your ruin. You will see in the end that what your father's disciple
tells you is for your own prosperity."

However, whatever the sage might say, Kapali could not bring himself
to believe him.

"What shall I do to feed my wife and children to-morrow if I sell
everything belonging to me to-day?"

Thus thought Kapali, and consulted his wife.

Now she was a very virtuous and intelligent woman. Said she:--

"My dear lord, we have heard that your father was a great mahatma. This
disciple must equally be a mahatma. His holiness would not advise us
to our ruin. Let us follow the sage's advice."

When Kapali's wife thus supported the sage, he resolved to dispose of
his beast and sack the next morning, and he did so accordingly. The
provisions he bought were enough to feed fifty Brahmins morning and
evening, as well as his own family. So that day he fed Brahmins for
the first time in his life. Night came on, and after an adventurous day
Kapali retired to sleep, but sleep he could not. Meanwhile Subrahmanya
was sleeping on the bare verandah outside the house, and he came to
the sage and said:--

"Holy sage, nearly half the night is spent, and there are only
fifteen ghatikas more for the dawn. What shall I do for the morrow
for my hungry children? All that I had I have spent. I have not even
a morsel of cold rice for the morning."

Subrahmanya showed him some money that he had in his hand, enough to
buy a buffalo and a sack of corn in case the great god did not help
him, and asked him to spend that night, at least the remainder of it,
in calm sleep. So Kapali, with his heart at ease, retired to rest.

He had not slept more than ten ghatikas when he dreamt that all
his family--his wife and children--were screaming for a mouthful
of rice. Suddenly he awoke and cursed his poverty which always
made such thoughts dwell uppermost in his mind. There were only
five ghatikas for the lord of the day to make his appearance in the
eastern horizon, and before this could happen he wanted to finish his
morning bath and ablutions, and so he went to his garden to bathe at
the well. The shed for the buffalo was erected in the garden, and it
had been his habit daily before bathing to give fresh straw to his
beast. That morning he thought he would be spared that duty. But,
wonder of wonders! He saw another buffalo standing there. He cursed
his poverty again which made him imagine impossibilities. How could it
be possible that his beast should be standing there when he had sold
it the previous morning? So he went into the shed and found a real
buffalo standing there. He could not believe his eyes, and hastily
brought a lamp from his house. It was, however, a real buffalo, and
beside it was a sack of corn! His heart leapt with joy, and he ran
out to tell his patron, Subrahmanya. But when the latter heard it he
said with a disgusted air:--

"My dear Kapali, why do you care so much? Why do you feel so
overjoyed? Take the beast at once with the corn-sack and sell them
as you did yesterday."

Kapali at once obeyed the orders and changed the money into
provisions. Again fifty Brahmins were fed the next day too, and
nothing was reserved for the third day's use. Thus it went on in
Kapali's house. Every morning he found a buffalo and a sack of corn,
which he sold and fed Brahmins with the proceeds. In this way a month
passed. Said Subrahmanya one day:--

"My dear Kapali, I am your holy father's disciple, and I would never
advise you to do a thing prejudicial to your welfare. When I came to
know that you were the son of the great sage, Jñananidhi, and were
leading so wretched a life, I came to see you in order to alleviate
your miseries. I have now done so, having pointed out the way to you
to live comfortably. Daily must you continue thus. Do as you have
been doing for the past month, and never store away anything, for if
you reserve a portion all this happiness may fail, and you will have
to revert to your former wretched life. I have done my duty towards
you. If you become ambitious of hoarding up money this good fortune
may desert you."

Kapali agreed to follow the advice of the sage to the uttermost detail
and requested him to remain in his house. Again said Subrahmanya:--

"My son! I have better work before me than living in your house. So
please excuse me. But before leaving you, I request you to inform
me as to where your sister is. She was a child of two years of age
when I saw her twenty years ago. She must be about twenty-two or
twenty-three now. Where is she?"

Tears trickled down the eyes of Kapali when his sister was
mentioned. Said he:--

"Do not, my patron, think of her. She is lost to the world. I am
ashamed to think of her. Why should we think of such a wretch at this
happy time?"

At once the inscription made by Brahma's nail rushed into Subrahmanya's
mind and he understood what was meant. Said he:--

"Never mind; be open and tell me where she is."

Then her brother, Kapali, with his eyes still wet with tears, said
that his sister, the daughter of the sage Jñananidhi, was leading the
worst of lives in an adjoining village, and that her name was Kalyani.

Subrahmanya took leave of Kapali and his wife, after blessing his
little children and again warning his friend. He had conferred what
happiness he could upon his master's son, and now the thought of
reforming his master's daughter reigned supreme in his heart. He
went at once to the village indicated and reached it at about
nightfall. After an easy search he found her house and knocked at the
door. The door was at once opened. But on that day she was astonished
to see a face such as she could never expect to approach her house.

"Do you know me, Kalyani?" said Subrahmanya, and she in reply said that
she did not. He then explained who he was, and when she came to know
that it was a disciple of her father that was standing before her she
wept most bitterly. The thought that after having been born of such
a holy sage, she had adopted so wretched a life, the most shameful in
the world, made her miserable at heart. She fell down at his feet and
asked to be forgiven. She then explained to him her extreme misery,
and the hard necessity which had compelled her to take to her present
way of living. He then consoled her and spoke thus:--

"My dear daughter! My heart burns within me when I see that necessity
has driven you to this wretched life. But I can redeem you if you
will only follow my advice. From this night you had better shut your
door, and never open it to any other person except to him who brings
to you a large measure full of pearls of the first water. You follow
this advice for a day and I shall then advise you further."

Being the daughter of a great sage, and having been compelled by
necessity to take to a wretched life, she readily consented to follow
her father's disciple when he promised to redeem her. She bolted the
door, and refused admission to anyone unless they brought a large
measure full of pearls. Her visitors, fancying that she must have
gone mad, went away. The night was almost drawing to a close and all
her friends had gone away disappointed. Who was there in the village
to give to her one measure full of pearls? But as the nail of Brahma
had appointed for her such a life as stated, some one was bound to
comply with her terms. And as there was no human being who could do
so, the god Brahma himself assumed the shape of a young man, and,
with a measure full of pearls, visited her in the last watch of the
night and remained with her.

When morning dawned he disappeared, and when Kalyani explained to the
disciple of her father the next morning that after all one person had
visited her with a measure full of pearls on the previous night, he was
glad to hear of it. He knew that his plan was working well. Said he:--

"My dear daughter, you are restored to your former good self hereafter
from this day. There are very few people in this world who could
afford to give you a measure full of pearls every night. So he that
brought you the pearls last night must continue to do so every night,
and he shall be hereafter your only husband. No other person must ever
hereafter see your face, and you must obey my orders. You must sell all
the pearls he brings you every day and convert them into money. This
money you should spend in feeding the poor and other charities. None
of it must you reserve for the next day, neither must you entertain
a desire to hoard up money. The day you fail to follow my advice you
will lose your husband, and then you will have to fall back on your
former wretched life."

Thus said Subrahmanya, and Kalyani agreed to strictly follow his
injunctions. He then went to live under a tree opposite to her house
for a month to see whether his plan was working well, and found it
worked admirably.

Thus, after having conferred happiness, to the best of his abilities,
on the son and daughter of his former master, Subrahmanya took
leave of Kalyani, and with her permission, most reluctantly given,
he pursued his pilgrimage.

One moonlight night, after a long sleep, Subrahmanya rose up almost
at midnight, and hearing the crows crowing he mistook it for the dawn
and commenced his journey. He had not proceeded far, when on his way
he met a beautiful person coming towards him, with a sack of corn
on his head and a bundle of pearls tied up in the end of his upper
cloth on his shoulder, leading a buffalo before him.

"Who are you, sir, walking thus in this forest?" said Subrahmanya.

When thus addressed, the person before him threw down the sack and
wept most bitterly.

"See, sir, my head is almost become bald by having to bear to Kapali's
house a sack of corn every night. This buffalo I lead to Kapali's
shed and this bundle of pearls I take to Kalyani's house. My nail
wrote their fate on their respective heads and by your device I have
to supply them with what my nail wrote. When will you relieve me of
these troubles?"

Thus wept Brahma, for it was no other personage. He was the creator
and protector of all beings, and when Subrahmanya had pointed out the
way for his master's children, and they had conquered fate, Brahma
too was conquered. So the great god soon gave them eternal felicity
and relieved himself of his troubles.
