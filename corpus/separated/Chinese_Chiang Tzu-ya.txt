Chiang Tzu-ya








In the wars which resulted in the overthrow of the tyrant Chou Wang
and his dynasty and the establishment of the great Chou dynasty,
the most influential generalissimo was Chiang Tzu-ya. His family name
was Chiang, and his own name Shang, but owing to his descent from one
of the ministers of the ancient King Yao, whose heirs owned the fief
of Lue, the family came to be called by that name, and he himself was
known as Lue Shang. His honorific title was T'ai Kung Wang, 'Hope of
T'ai Kung,' given him by Wen Wang, who recognized in the person of
Chiang Tzu-ya the wise minister whom his father T'ai Kung had caused
him to expect before his death.
