THE COCK AND HEN



(In this tale the notes of the Cock and Hen must be imitated.)

_Hen_--You promise me shoes year after year, year after year,
and yet I get no shoes!

_Cock_--You shall have them, never fear! Henny penny!

_Hen_--I lay egg after egg, egg after egg, and yet I go about
barefoot!

_Cock_--Well, take your eggs, and be off to the tryst, and buy
yourself shoes, and don't go any longer barefoot!
