Sun bestows Talismans








Sun quickly changed himself from a Taoist priest, and appeared in
his natural form. At this they all fell down and worshipped him,
asking his forgiveness because their mortal eyes could not recognize
him. They then begged him to enter the city and compel the demons to
repent. Sun told them to follow him. He then went with them to a sandy
place, emptied two carts and smashed them into splinters, and threw
all the bricks, tiles, and timber into a heap, calling upon all the
priests to disperse. "Tomorrow," he said, "I am going to see the King,
and will destroy the Taoists!" Then they said: "Sir, we dare not go
any farther, lest they attempt to seize you and cause trouble." "Have
no fear," he replied; "but if you think so I will give you a charm to
protect you." He pulled out some hairs, and gave one to each to hold
firmly on the third finger. "If anyone tries to seize you," he said,
"keep tight hold of it, call out 'Great Holy One, the Equal of Heaven,'
and I will at once come to your rescue, even though I be ten thousand
miles away." Some of them tried the charm, and, sure enough, there
he was before them like the God of Thunder. In his hand he held a
rod of iron, and he could keep ten thousand men and horses at bay.
