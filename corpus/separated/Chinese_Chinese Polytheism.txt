Chinese Polytheism








That the names of the gods of China are legion will be readily
conceded when it is said that, besides those already described,
those still to be mentioned, and many others to whom space will not
permit us to refer, there are also gods, goddesses, patrons, etc.,
of wind, rain, snow, frost, rivers, tides, caves, trees, flowers,
theatres, horses, oxen, cows, sheep, goats, dogs, pigs, scorpions,
locusts, gold, tea, salt, compass, archery, bridges, lamps, gems,
wells, carpenters, masons, barbers, tailors, jugglers, nets, wine,
bean-curd, jade, paper-clothing, eye, ear, nose, tongue, teeth,
heart, liver, throat, hands, feet, skin, architecture, rain-clothes,
monkeys, lice, Punch and Judy, fire-crackers, cruelty, revenge, manure,
fornication, shadows, corners, gamblers, oculists, smallpox, liver
complaint, stomach-ache, measles, luck, womb, midwives, hasteners
of child-birth, brigands, butchers, furnishers, centipedes, frogs,
stones, beds, candle-merchants, fishermen, millers, wig-merchants,
incense-merchants, spectacle-makers, cobblers, harness-makers,
seedsmen, innkeepers, basket-makers, chemists, painters, perfumers,
jewellers, brush-makers, dyers, fortune-tellers, strolling singers,
brothels, varnishers, combs, etc., etc. There is a god of the light
of the eye as well as of the eye itself, of smallpox-marks as well as
of smallpox, of 'benign' measles as well as of measles. After reading
a full list of the gods of China, those who insist that the religion
of China was or is a monotheism may be disposed to revise their belief.
