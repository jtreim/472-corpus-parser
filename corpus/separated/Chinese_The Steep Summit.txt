The Steep Summit








One day T'ai-i Huang-jen sent him to cut some bamboos on the summit of
O-mei Shan, distant more than three hundred _li_ from the place where
they lived. When he reached the base of the summit, all of a sudden
three giddy peaks confronted him, so dangerous that even the monkeys
and other animals dared not attempt to scale them. But he took his
courage in his hands, climbed the steep slope, and by sheer energy
reached the summit. Having cut the bamboos, he tried to descend, but
the rocks rose like a wall in sharp points all round him, and he could
not find a foothold anywhere. Then, though laden with the bamboos, he
threw himself into the air, and was borne on the wings of the wind. He
came to earth safe and sound at the foot of the mountain, and ran with
the bamboos to his master. On account of this feat he was considered
advanced enough to be admitted to instruction in the doctrine.
