The One-legged Bird








At the time when Hsuean-ming Ta-jen instructed Fei Lien in the secrets
of magic, the latter saw a wonderful bird which drew in water with its
beak and blew it out again in the shape of rain. Fei lien tamed it,
and would take it about in his sleeve.

Later on a one-legged bird was seen in the palace of the Prince of
Ch'i walking up and down and hopping in front of the throne. Being
much puzzled, the Prince sent a messenger to Lu to inquire of Confucius
concerning this strange behaviour. "This bird is a _shang yang_" said
Confucius; "its appearance is a sign of rain. In former times the
children used to amuse themselves by hopping on one foot, knitting
their eyebrows, and saying: 'It will rain, because the _shang yang_
is disporting himself.' Since this bird has gone to Ch'i, heavy rain
will fall, and the people should be told to dig channels and repair
the dykes, for the whole country will be inundated." Not only Ch'i, but
all the adjacent kingdoms were flooded; all sustained grievous damage
except Ch'i, where the necessary precautions had been taken. This
caused Duke Ching to exclaim: "Alas! how few listen to the words of
the sages!"
