The Red Child Demon








By the autumn the travellers arrived at a great mountain. They saw
on the road a red cloud which the Monkey thought must be a demon. It
was in fact a demon child who, in order to entrap the Master, had had
himself bound and tied to the branch of a tree. The child repeatedly
cried out to the passers-by to deliver him. Sun suspected that it was
a trick; but the Master could no longer endure the pitiful wails; he
ordered his disciples to loose the child, and the Monkey to carry him.

As they proceeded on their way the Demon caused a strong whirlwind to
spring up, and during this he carried off the Master. Sun discovered
that the Demon was an old friend of his, who, centuries before, had
pledged himself to eternal friendship. So he consoled his comrades
by saying that he felt sure no harm would come to the Master.
