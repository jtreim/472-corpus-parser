STORY OF THE POISONED FOOD



There was a city called Vijayanagara, to the north of which flowed
a small river with mango topes Three days before there had come to the same spot an old Brahmin whose
years numbered more than three score and ten; he had quarrelled with
his family, and had fled from his house to die. Since he had reached
that place he had tasted no food, and the young pilgrim found him lying
in a pitiable state, and placed near him a portion of his rice. The old
man arose, and proceeded to the rivulet in order to wash his feet and
hands, and pronounce a holy incantation or two before tasting the food.

While thus engaged a kite, carrying in its beak a huge serpent,
alighted upon the tree at the foot of which was the rice given by
the pilgrim to the old man, and while the bird was feasting on the
serpent some of its poison dropped on the rice, and the old Brahmin,
in his hunger, did not observe it on his return; he greedily devoured
some of the rice, and instantly fell down dead.

The young pilgrim, seeing him prostrate on the ground, ran to help
him, but found that life was gone; and concluding that the old man's
hasty eating after his three days' fast must have caused his death,
and being unwilling to leave his corpse to be devoured by kites and
jackals, he determined to cremate it before resuming his journey. With
this object he ran to the neighbouring village, and, reporting to the
people what had occurred on the tope, requested their assistance in
cremating the old man's body.

The villagers, however, suspected that the young pilgrim had killed
and robbed the old Brahmin; so they laid hold of him, and, after
giving him a severe flogging, imprisoned him in the village temple
of Kali. Alas! what a reward was this for his kind hospitality! and
how was he repaid for his beneficence!

The unhappy pilgrim gave vent to his sorrows in the form of verses
in praise of the goddess in whose temple he was a prisoner; for he
was a great Pandit, versed in the four Vedas, and the six Sastras,
and the sixty-four varieties of knowledge. On hearing the pilgrim's
verses, the rage of the goddess descended upon the villagers, who
had so rashly accused and punished him for a crime of which he was
innocent. Suddenly the whole village was destroyed by fire, and the
people lost all their property, and were houseless. In their extremity
they went to the temple of Kali, and humbly requested the goddess to
inform them of the cause of the calamity which had thus unexpectedly
come upon them. The goddess infused herself into the person of one
of the villagers, and thus responded:--

"Know ye, unkind villagers, that ye have most unjustly scourged
and imprisoned in our presence an innocent, charitable, and pious
Brahmin. The old man died from the effects of the poison, which dropped
from a serpent's mouth on some rice at the foot of a tree when it
was being devoured by a kite. Ye did not know of this; nevertheless
ye have maltreated a good man without first making due inquiry as to
his guilt or innocence. For this reason we visited your village with
this calamity. Beware, and henceforward avoid such sins."

So saying, Kali departed from the person through whom she had
manifested herself. "Even so," continued Bodhaditya, "my most noble sovereign, I have
this day had to endure the infamy of having violated the harem for
saving your valuable life."

He then sent for a thief who was undergoing imprisonment, and gave
him the handful of rice which he had the preceding day snatched
from the king at dinner, and the thief having eaten it, instantly
died. He next caused a servant to go to the royal bed-chamber, and
fetch from the canopy of the couch the pieces of the serpent and his
little finger-tip, which he laid before the wonder-struck king and
the counsellors, and then addressed his majesty as follows:--

"My most noble king, and ye wise counsellors, it is known to you
all that we four ministers keep watch over the town during the four
quarters of the night, and mine is the first watch. Well, while I
was on duty the day before yesterday, I heard a weeping voice in the
direction of the temple. I proceeded to the spot, and discovered the
goddess sobbing bitterly. She related to me how three calamities
awaited the king on the morrow. The first of them was the arrows
despatched by the king of Vijayanagara as sweetmeats to our Sovereign;
the second was the poisoned rice, and the third the serpent. In trying
to avert these calamities, I have committed the offence of entering
the harem."

And he thereupon explained the whole affair from first to last.

King Alakesa and the whole assembly were highly delighted at the
fidelity and devotion of Bodhaditya; for it was now very evident
that he had done nothing amiss, but had saved the life of the king
on three occasions, and indeed also the life of the queen by wiping
off the serpent's poison which had fallen on her bosom. Then Alakesa
related the following story in explanation of the proverb:--
