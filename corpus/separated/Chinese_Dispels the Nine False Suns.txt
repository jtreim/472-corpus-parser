Dispels the Nine False Suns








After this first victory Shen I led his troops to the banks of the
Hsi Ho, West River, at Lin Shan. Here he discovered that on three
neighbouring peaks nine extraordinary birds were blowing out fire and
thus forming nine new suns in the sky. Shen I shot nine arrows in
succession, pierced the birds, and immediately the nine false suns
resolved themselves into red clouds and melted away. Shen I and his
soldiers found the nine arrows stuck in nine red stones at the top
of the mountain.
