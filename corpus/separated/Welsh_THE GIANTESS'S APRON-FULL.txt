THE GIANTESS’S APRON-FULL




A huge giant, in company with his wife, travelling towards the island of
Mona, with an intention of settling amongst the first inhabitants that
had removed there, and having been informed that there was but a narrow
channel which divided it from the continent, took up two large stones,
one under each arm, to carry with him as a preparatory for making a
bridge over this channel, and his lady had her apron filled with small
stones for the same purpose; but, meeting a man on this spot with a
large parcel of old shoes on his shoulders, the giant asked him how far
it was to Mona. The man replied, that it was so far, that he had worn
out those shoes in travelling from Mona to that place. The giant on
hearing this dropped down the stones, one on each side of him, where
they now stand upright, about a hundred yards or more distant from each
other; the space between them was occupied by this Goliah’s body.
His mistress at the same time opened her apron, and dropped down the
contents of it, which formed this heap.
