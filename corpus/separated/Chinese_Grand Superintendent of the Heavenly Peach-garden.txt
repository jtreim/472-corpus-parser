Grand Superintendent of the Heavenly Peach-garden








Yue Huang in great indignation organized a siege of Hua-kuo Shan,
but the Kings of Heaven and the generals with their celestial armies
were repulsed several times. Sun now arrogated to himself the pompous
title of Grand Saint, Governor of Heaven. He had this emblazoned on
his banners, and threatened Yue Huang that he would carry destruction
into his kingdom if he refused to recognize his new dignity. Yue
Huang, alarmed at the result of the military operations, agreed to
the condition laid down by Sun. The latter was then appointed Grand
Superintendent of the Heavenly Peach-garden, the fruit of which
conferred immortality, and a new palace was built for him.
