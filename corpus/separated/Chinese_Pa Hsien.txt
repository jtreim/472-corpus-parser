Pa Hsien








Either singly or in groups the Eight Immortals, Pa Hsien, of the Taoist
religion are one of the most popular subjects of representation in
China; their portraits are to be seen everywhere--on porcelain vases,
teapots, teacups, fans, scrolls, embroidery, etc. Images of them are
made in porcelain, earthenware, roots, wood, metals. The term 'Eight
Immortals' is figuratively used for happiness. The number eight has
become lucky in association with this tradition, and persons or things
eight in number are graced accordingly. Thus we read of reverence shown
to the 'Eight Genii Table' (_Pa Hsien Cho_), the 'Eight Genii Bridge'
(_Pa Hsien Ch'iao_), 'Eight Genii Vermicelli' (_Pa Hsien Mien_), the
'Eight Genii of the Wine-cup' (_Tin Chung Pa Hsien_)--wine-bibbers of
the T'ang dynasty celebrated by Tu Fu, the poet. They are favourite
subjects of romance, and special objects of adoration. In them we see
"the embodiment of the ideas of perfect but imaginary happiness which
possess the minds of the Chinese people." Three of them (Chung-li
Ch'uean, Chang Kuo, and Lue Yen) were historical personages; the others
are mentioned only in fables or romances. They represent all kinds
of people--old, young, male, female, civil, military, rich, poor,
afflicted, cultured, noble. They are also representative of early,
middle, and later historical periods.

The legend of the Eight Immortals is certainly not older than the time
of the Sung dynasty (A.D. 960-1280), and is probably to be assigned
to that of the Yuean dynasty (1280-1368). But some, if not all, of
the group seem to have been previously celebrated as Immortals in the
Taoist legends. Their biographies are usually arranged in the order
of their official eminence or seniority in age. Here I follow that
adopted in _Hsiu hsiang Pa Hsien tung yu chi_  in which they are
described in the order in which they became Immortals.
