The Women's Kingdom








The Women's Kingdom, the country inhabited exclusively by women, is
said to be surrounded by a sea of less density than ordinary water,
so that ships sink on approaching the shores. It has been reached only
by boats carried thither in whirlwinds, and but few of those wrecked
on its rocks have survived and returned to tell of its wonders. The
women have houses, gardens, and shops. Instead of money they use gems,
perforated and strung like beads. They reproduce their kind by sleeping
where the south wind blows upon them.
