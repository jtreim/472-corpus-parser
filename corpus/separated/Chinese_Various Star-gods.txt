Various Star-gods








Some of the star-gods, such as the God of Literature, the Goddess of
the North Star, the Gods of Happiness, Longevity, etc., are noticed
in other parts of this work. The cycle-gods are also star-gods. There
are sixty years in a cycle, and over each of these presides a special
star-deity. The one worshipped is the one which gave light on the
birthday of the worshipper, and therefore the latter burns candles
before that particular image on each succeeding anniversary. These
cycle-gods are represented by most grotesque images: "white, black,
yellow, and red; ferocious gods with vindictive eyeballs popping out,
and gentle faces as expressive as a lump of putty; some looking like
men and some like women." In one temple one of the sixty was in the
form of a hog, and another in that of a goose. "Here is an image
with arms protruding out of his eye-sockets, and eyes in the palms
of his hands, looking downward to see the secret things within the
earth. See that rabbit, Minerva-like, jumping from the divine head;
again a mud-rat emerges from his occipital hiding-place, and lo! a
snake comes coiling from the brain of another god--so the long line
serves as models for an artist who desires to study the fantastic."
