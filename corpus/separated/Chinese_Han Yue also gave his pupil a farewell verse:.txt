Han Yue also gave his pupil a farewell verse:








How many here below allow themselves to be inebriated by the love
of honours and pelf! Alone and watchful you persevere in the right
path. But a time will come when, taking your flight to the sky,
you will open in the ethereal blue a luminous roadway.

Han Yue was depressed at the thought of the damp climate of his place
of exile. "I fear there is no doubt," he said, "that I shall die
without seeing my family again."

Han Hsiang Tzu consoled him, gave him a prescription, and said: "Not
only will you return in perfect health to the bosom of your family,
but you will be reinstated in your former offices." All this took
place exactly as he had predicted.

Another account states that he became the disciple of Lue Tung-pin, and,
having been carried up to the supernatural peach-tree of the genii,
fell from its branches, but during his descent attained to the state
of immortality. Still another version says that he was killed by the
fall, was transformed, and then underwent the various experiences
with Han Yue already related.
