Ch'iung Hsiao's Magic Scissors








In another of the many conflicts between the two rival states Lao Tzu
entered the battle, whereupon Ch'iung Hsiao, a goddess who fought for
the house of Shang (Chou), hurled into the air her gold scaly-dragon
scissors. As these slowly descended, opening and closing in a most
ominous manner, Lao Tzu waved the sleeve of his jacket and they fell
into the sea and became absolutely motionless. Many similar tricks
were used by the various contestants. The Gold Bushel of Chaotic
Origin succumbed to the Wind-fire Sphere, and so on. Ch'iung Hsiao
resumed the attack with some magic two-edged swords, but was killed
by a blow from White Crane Youth's Three-precious Jade Sceptre, hurled
at her by Lao Tzu's orders. Pi Hsiao, her sister, attempted to avenge
her death, but Yuean-shih, producing from his sleeve a magical box,
threw it into the air and caught Pi Hsiao in it. When it was opened
it was found that she had melted into blood and water.
