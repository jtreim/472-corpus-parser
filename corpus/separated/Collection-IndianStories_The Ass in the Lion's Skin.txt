The Ass in the Lion's Skin



"Not at all!" replied the wily money-lender; "you will have your
share! Now, don't be a dog in the manger, for if _you_ get all you
want, what can it matter to you if _I_ am rich or poor?"

At last, though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefit
to a money-lender, the farmer was forced to yield, and from that time,
no matter what he gained by the power of the conch, the money-lender
gained double. And the knowledge that this was so preyed upon the
farmer's mind day and night, so that he had no satisfaction out of
anything.

At last, there came a very dry season,--so dry that the farmer's crops
withered for want of rain. Then he blew his conch, and wished for a
well to water them, and lo! there was the well, _but the money-lender
had two!_--two beautiful new wells! This was too much for any farmer
to stand; and our friend brooded over it, and brooded over it, till at
last a bright idea came into his head. He seized the conch, blew it
loudly, and cried out, "Oh, Ram! I wish to be blind of one eye!" And
so he was, in a twinkling, but the money-lender of course was blind of
both, and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells, he
fell into one, and was drowned.

Now this true story shows that a farmer once got the better of a
money-lender--but only by losing one of his eyes.
