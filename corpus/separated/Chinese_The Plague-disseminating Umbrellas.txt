The Plague-disseminating Umbrellas








Resolved to avenge his defeat, he joined General Hsue Fang, who was
commanding an army corps at Ch'uan-yuen Kuan. Round the mountain he
organized a system of entrenchments and of infection against their
enemies. Yang Chien released his celestial hound, which bit Lue Yueeh
on the crown of his head. Then Yang Jen, armed with his magic fan,
pursued Lue Yueeh and compelled him to retreat to his fortress. Lue
Yueeh mounted the central raised part of the embattled wall and opened
all his plague-disseminating umbrellas, with the object of infecting
Yang Jen, but the latter, simply by waving his fan, reduced all the
umbrellas to dust, and also burned the fort, and with it Lue Yueeh.

Similar wonderful achievements are related in short notices in the
_Feng shen yen i_ of the four other officers of the Ministry.

Li P'ing, the sixth officer of the Ministry, met a like fate to that
of Lue Yueeh after having failed to induce the latter to abandon the
cause of the Shang dynasty for that of Chou.
