The Mother of Lightning








This divinity is represented as a female figure, gorgeously apparelled
in blue, green, red, and white, holding in either hand a mirror from
which proceed two broad streams or flashes of light. Lightning, say
the Chinese, is caused by the rubbing together of the _yin_ and the
_yang_, just as sparks of fire may be produced by the friction of
two substances.
