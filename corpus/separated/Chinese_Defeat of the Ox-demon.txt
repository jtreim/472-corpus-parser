Defeat of the Ox-demon








The Ox-demon being of so fierce and terrible a nature, both Buddha
in Heaven and the Taoist Celestial Ruler sent down whole legions of
celebrated warriors to help the Master's servant. The Ox-demon tried
to escape in every direction, one after the other, but his efforts
were in vain. Finally defeated, he was made to promise for himself and
his wife to give up their evil ways and to follow the holy precepts
of the Buddhist doctrine.

The Magic Fan was given to Sun, who at once proceeded to test its
powers. When he waved it once the fires on Flaming Mountain died
out. When he waved it a second time a gentle breeze sprang up. When
he waved it a third time refreshing rain fell everywhere, and the
pilgrims proceeded on their way in comfort.
