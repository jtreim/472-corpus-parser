Kills Chisel-tooth








On reaching home, the archer hid his precious pill under a rafter,
lest anyone should steal it, and then began the preparatory course
in immortality.

At this time there appeared in the south a strange man named Tso Ch'ih,
'Chisel-tooth.' He had round eyes and a long projecting tooth. He
was a well-known criminal. Yao ordered Shen I and his small band
of brave followers to deal with this new enemy. This extraordinary
man lived in a cave, and when Shen I and his men arrived he emerged
brandishing a padlock. Shen I broke his long tooth by shooting an
arrow at it, and Tso Ch'ih fled, but was struck in the back and laid
low by another arrow from Shen I. The victor took the broken tooth
with him as a trophy.
