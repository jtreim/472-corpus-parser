The God of the Immortals








Mu Kung or Tung Wang Kung, the God of the Immortals, was also called
I Chuen Ming and Yue Huang Chuen, the Prince Yue Huang.

The primitive vapour congealed, remained inactive for a time, and
then produced living beings, beginning with the formation of Mu Kung,
the purest substance of the Eastern Air, and sovereign of the active
male principle _yang_ and of all the countries of the East. His
palace is in the misty heavens, violet clouds form its dome, blue
clouds its walls. Hsien T'ung, 'the Immortal Youth,' and Yue Nue,
'the Jade Maiden,' are his servants. He keeps the register of all
the Immortals, male and female.
