Immortal for Suffering








They replied: "A great number have died. At one time we numbered
more than two thousand. But through deaths and suicides there now
remain only about five hundred. And we who remain cannot die. Ropes
cannot strangle us, swords cannot cut us; if we plunge into the
river we cannot sink; poison does not kill us." Sun said: "Then
you are fortunate, for you are all Immortals." "Alas!" said they,
"we are immortal only for suffering. We get poor food. We have only
sand to sleep on. But in the night hours spirits appear to us and
tell us not to kill ourselves, for an Arhat will come from the East
to deliver us. With him there is a disciple, the Great Holy One,
the Equal of Heaven, most powerful and tender-hearted. He will put
an end to these Taoists and have pity on us Buddhists."
