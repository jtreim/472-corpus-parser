P'an Ku and Ymer








Thus we have the heavens and the earth fashioned by this wonderful
being in eighteen thousand years. With regard to him we may adapt
the Scandinavian ballad:


    It was Time's morning
    When P'an Ku lived;
    There was no sand, no sea,
    Nor cooling billows;



    Earth there was none,
    No lofty Heaven;
    No spot of living green;
    Only a deep profound.


And it is interesting to note, in passing, the similarity between this
Chinese artificer of the universe and Ymer, the giant, who discharges
the same functions in Scandinavian mythology. Though P'an Ku did not
have the same kind of birth nor meet with the violent death of the
latter, the results as regards the origin of the universe seem to
have been pretty much the same.
