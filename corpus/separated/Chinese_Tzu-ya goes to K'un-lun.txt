Tzu-ya goes to K'un-lun








Tzu-ya, however, still uncertain in mind about the finality of No-cha's
victories, went to consult Wu Wang (whose death had not yet taken
place at this time). After the interview Tzu-ya informed Wu Wang of
his wish to visit K'un-lun Mountain. Wu Wang warned him of the danger
of leaving the kingdom with the enemy so near the capital; but Tzu-ya
obtained his consent by saying he would be absent only three days
at most. So he gave instructions regarding the defence to No-cha,
and went off in his spirit chariot to K'un-lun. On his arrival at the
Unicorn Precipice he was much enraptured with the beautiful scenery,
the colours, flowers, trees, bridges, birds, deer, apes, blue lions,
white elephants, etc., all of which seemed to make earth surpass
Heaven in loveliness.
