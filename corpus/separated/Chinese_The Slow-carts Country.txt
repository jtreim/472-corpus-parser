The Slow-carts Country








Having crossed the Blackwater River, they journeyed westward,
facing wind and snow. Suddenly they heard a great shout as of
ten thousand voices. The Master was alarmed, but Sun laughingly
went to investigate. Sitting on a cloud, he rose in the air, and
saw a city, outside of which there were thousands of priests and
carts laden with bricks and all kinds of building materials. This
was the city where Taoists were respected, and Buddhists were not
wanted. The Monkey, who appeared among the people as a Taoist, was
informed that the country was called the Ch'e Ch'ih, 'Slow-carts
Country,' and for twenty years had been ruled by three Taoists who
could procure rain during times of drought. Their names were Tiger,
Deer, and Sheep. They could also command the wind, and change stones
into gold. The Monkey said to the two leading Taoists: "I wonder
if I shall be so fortunate as to see your Emperor?" They replied:
"We will see to that when we have attended to our business." The
Monkey inquired what business the priests could have. "In former
times," they said, "when our King ordered the Buddhists to pray for
rain, their prayers were not answered. Then the Taoists prayed, and
copious showers fell. Since then all the Buddhist priests have been
our slaves, and have to carry the building materials, as you see. We
must assign them their work, and then will come to you." Sun replied:
"Never mind; I am in search of an uncle of mine, from whom I have not
heard for many years. Perhaps he is here among your slaves." They said:
"You may see if you can find him."
