Kings of Heaven








The Four Kings of Heaven, Ssu Ta T'ien-wang, reside on Mount Sumeru
(Hsue-mi Shan), the centre of the universe. It is 3,360,000 _li_--that
is, about a million miles--high.  Its eastern slope is of gold, its
western of silver, its south-eastern of crystal, and its north-eastern
of agate. The Four Kings appear to be the Taoist reflection of the
four _Chin-kang_ of Buddhism already noticed. Their names are Li,
Ma, Chao, and Wen. They are represented as holding a pagoda, sword,
two swords, and spiked club respectively. Their worship appears to
be due to their auspicious appearance and aid on various critical
occasions in the dynastic history of the T'ang and Sung Periods.
