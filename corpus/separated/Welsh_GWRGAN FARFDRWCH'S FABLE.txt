GWRGAN FARFDRWCH’S FABLE




Hear me, O ye Britons! On the top of a high rock in Arvon there stood
a goat, which a lion perceiving from the valley below, addressed her in
this manner:--

“My dearest neighbour, why preferrest thou that dry barren rock to
feed on? Come down to this charming valley, where thou mayest feed
luxuriously upon all sorts of dainties, amongst flowers in shady groves,
made fruitful by meandering brooks.”

“I am much obliged to you, master,” replied the goat; “perhaps you mean
well, and tell me the truth, but you have very bad neighbours, whom I
do not like to trust, and those are your teeth, so, with your leave, I
prefer staying where I am.”
