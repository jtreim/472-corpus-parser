Han Hsiang Tzu








Han Hsiang Tzu, who is depicted with a bouquet of flowers or a basket
of peaches of immortality, is stated to have been a grand-nephew of
Han Yue (A.D. 768-824), the great statesman, philosopher, and poet of
the T'ang dynasty, and an ardent votary of transcendental study. His
own name was Ch'ing Fu. The child was entrusted to his uncle to
be educated and prepared for the public examinations. He excelled
his teacher in intelligence and the performance of wonderful feats,
such as the production from a little earth in a flower-pot of some
marvellous flowering plants, on the leaves of which were written in
letters of gold some verses to this effect:


    The clouds hide Mount Ch'in Ling.
      Where is your abode?
    The snow is deep on Lan Kuan;
      Your horse refuses to advance.


"What is the meaning of these verses?" asked Han Yue. "You will see,"
replied Han Hsiang Tzu.

Some time afterward Han Yue was sent in disgrace to the prefecture of
Ch'ao-chou Fu in Kuangtung. When he reached the foot of Lan Kuan the
snow was so deep that he could not go on. Han Hsiang Tzu appeared, and,
sweeping away the snow, made a path for him. Han Yue then understood
the prophecy in his pupil's verses.

When Han Hsiang Tzu was leaving his uncle, he gave him the following
in verse:

Many indeed are the eminent men who have served their country, but
which of them surpasses you in his knowledge of literature? When
you have reached a high position, you will be buried in a damp and
foggy land.
