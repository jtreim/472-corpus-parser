The Ministry of Thunder and Storms








As already noted, affairs in the Otherworld are managed by official
Bureaux or Ministries very similar to those on earth. The _Feng shen
yen i_ mentions several of these, and gives full details of their
constitution. The first is the Ministry of Thunder and Storms. This
is composed of a large number of officials. The principal ones are
Lei Tsu, the Ancestor of Thunder, Lei Kung, the Duke of Thunder, Tien
Mu, the Mother of Lightning, Feng Po, the Count of Wind, and Y
Shih, the Master of Rain. These correspond to the Buddhist Asuras,
the "fourth class of sentient beings, the mightiest of all demons,
titanic enemies of the Devas," and the Vedic Maruta, storm-demons. In
the temples Lei Tsu is placed in the centre with the other four to
right and left. There are also sometimes represented other gods of
rain, or attendants. These are Hsing T'ien Chuen and T'ao T'ien Chuen,
both officers of Wen Chung, or Lei Tsu, Ma Yuean-shuai, Generalissimo
Ma, whose exploits are referred to later, and others.
