The Murderer Executed








The following day a report was presented to the Emperor, who gave
orders for the immediate arrest and execution of the murderer of
Ch'en Kuang-jui.

Yin K'ai-shan went with all haste to Chen-chiang, where he arrived
during the night, surrounded the official residence, and seized
the culprit, whom he sent to the place where he had committed the
murder. His heart and liver were torn out and sacrificed to the victim.
