How the Master was Rescued








When Pa-chieh at length had disentangled himself from the webs, he saw
Sun and Sha Ho-shang approaching. Having learnt what had happened,
they feared the women might do some injury to the Master, so they
ran to the cave to rescue him. On the way they were beset by the
seven dwarf sons of the seven women, who transformed themselves into
a swarm of dragon-flies, bees, and other insects. But Sun pulled out
some hairs and, changing them into seven different swarms of flying
insects, destroyed the hostile swarm, and the ground was covered a
foot deep with the dead bodies. On reaching the cave, the pilgrims
found it had been deserted by the women. They released the Master,
and made him promise never to beg for food again. Having given the
promise, he mounted his horse, and they proceeded on their journey.
