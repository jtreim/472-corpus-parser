Sun Hou-tzu Captured








These numerous misdeeds aroused the indignation of all the gods and
goddesses. Accusations poured in upon Yue Huang, and he ordered the Four
Gods of the Heavens and their chief generals to bring Sun to him. The
armies laid siege to Hua-kuo Shan, a net was spread in the heavens,
fantastic battles took place, but the resistance of the enemy was as
strenuous and obstinate as before.

Lao Chuen and Erh-lang, nephew of Yue Huang, then appeared on the
scene. Sun's warriors resisted gallantly, but the forces of Heaven
were too much for them, and at length they were overcome. At this
juncture Sun changed his form, and in spite of the net in the sky
managed to find a way out. In vain search was made everywhere, until
Li T'ien-wang, by the help of his devil-finding mirror, detected the
quarry and informed Erh-lang, who rushed off in pursuit. Lao Chuen
hurled his magic ring on to the head of the fugitive, who stumbled
and fell. Quick as lightning, the celestial dog, T'ien Kou, who was
in Erh-lang's service, threw himself on him, bit him in the calf,
and caused him to stumble afresh. This was the end of the fight. Sun,
surrounded on all sides, was seized and chained. The battle was won.
