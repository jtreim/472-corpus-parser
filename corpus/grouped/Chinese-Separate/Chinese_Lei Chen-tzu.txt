Lei Chen-tzu








Another Son of Thunder is Lei Chen-tzu, mentioned above, whose name
when a child was Wen Yue, who was hatched from an egg after a clap
of thunder and found by the soldiers of Wen Wang in some brushwood
near an old tomb. The infant's chief characteristic was its brilliant
eyes. Wen Wang, who already had ninety-nine children, adopted it as
his hundredth, but gave it to a hermit named Yuen Chung-tzu to rear
as his disciple. The hermit showed him the way to rescue his adopted
father from the tyrant who held him prisoner. In seeking for some
powerful weapon the child found on the hillside two apricots, and
ate them both. He then noticed that wings had grown on his shoulders,
and was too much ashamed to return home.

But the hermit, who knew intuitively what had taken place, sent a
servant to seek him. When they met the servant said: "Do you know that
your face is completely altered?" The mysterious fruit had not only
caused Lei Chen-tzu to grow wings, known as Wings of the Wind and
Thunder, but his face had become green, his nose long and pointed,
and two tusks protruded horizontally from each side of his mouth,
while his eyes shone like mirrors.

Lei Chen-tzu now went and rescued Wen Wang, dispersing his enemies
by means of his mystical power and bringing the old man back on his
shoulders. Having placed him in safety he returned to the hermit.
