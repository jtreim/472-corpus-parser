The Lovely Women








Having travelled over many mountains, the travellers came to a
village. The Master said: "You, my disciples, are always very kind,
taking round the begging-bowl and getting food for me. To-day I will
take the begging-bowl myself." But Sun said: "That is not right; you
must let us, your disciples, do this for you." But the Master insisted.

When he reached the village, there was not a man to be seen, but only
some lovely women. He did not think that it was right for him to speak
to women. On the other hand, if he did not procure anything for their
meal, his disciples would make fun of him. So, after long hesitation,
he went forward and begged food of them. They invited him to their cave
home, and, having learnt who he was, ordered food for him, but it was
all human flesh. The Master informed them that he was a vegetarian,
and rose to take his departure, but instead of letting him go they
surrounded and bound him, thinking that he would be a fine meal for
them next day.
