Sha Ho-shang








One of the principal of Sun's fellow-servants of the Master was
Sha Ho-shang.

He is depicted wearing a necklace of skulls, the heads of the nine
Chinese deputies sent in former centuries to find the Buddhist canon,
but whom Sha Ho-shang had devoured on the banks of Liu-sha River when
they had attempted to cross it.

He is also known by the name of Sha Wu-ching, and was originally
Grand Superintendent of the Manufactory of Stores for Yue Huang's
palace. During a great banquet given on the Peach Festival to all
the gods and Immortals of the Chinese Olympus he let fall a crystal
bowl, which was smashed to atoms. Yue Huang caused him to be beaten
with eight hundred blows, drove him out of Heaven, and exiled him to
earth. He lived on the banks of the Liu-sha Ho, where every seventh
day a mysterious sword appeared and wounded him in the neck. Having
no other means of subsistence, he used to devour the passers-by.
