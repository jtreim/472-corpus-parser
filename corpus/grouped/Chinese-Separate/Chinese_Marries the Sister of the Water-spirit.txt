Marries the Sister of the Water-spirit








Shen I then led his soldiers to Kao-liang, where the river had risen
and formed an immense torrent. He shot an arrow into the water,
which thereupon withdrew to its source. In the flood he saw a man
clothed in white, riding a white horse and accompanied by a dozen
attendants. He quickly discharged an arrow, striking him in the left
eye, and the horseman at once took to flight. He was accompanied
by a young woman named Heng O , the younger sister of Ho Po,
the Spirit of the Waters. Shen I shot an arrow into her hair. She
turned and thanked him for sparing her life, adding: "I will agree
to be your wife." After these events had been duly reported to the
Emperor Yao, the wedding took place.
