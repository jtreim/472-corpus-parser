Grand Master of the Heavenly Stables








In order to keep him occupied, Sun was appointed Grand Master of the
Heavenly Stables, and was entrusted with the feeding of Yue Huang's
horses; his official celestial title being Pi-ma Wen. Later on,
learning the object of the creation of this derisory appointment,
he overturned the Master's throne, seized his staff, broke down the
South Gate of Heaven, and descended on a cloud to Hua-kuo Shan.
