Hsi Wang Mu








Hsi Wang Mu was formed of the pure quintessence of the Western Air,
in the legendary continent of Shen Chou. She is often called the
Golden Mother of the Tortoise.

Her family name is variously given as Hou, Yang, and Ho. Her own name
was Hui, and first name Wan-chin. She had nine sons and twenty-four
daughters.

As Mu Kung, formed of the Eastern Air, is the active principle of
the male air and sovereign of the Eastern Air, so Hsi Wang Mu, born
of the Western Air, is the passive or female principle (_yin_) and
sovereign of the Western Air. These two principles, co-operating,
engender Heaven and earth and all the beings of the universe, and
thus become the two principles of life and of the subsistence of all
that exists. She is the head of the troop of genii dwelling on the
K'un-lun Mountains (the Taoist equivalent of the Buddhist Sumeru), and
from time to time holds intercourse with favoured imperial votaries.
