The Power of the Magic Fan








The Ox-demon, following after Sun, saw him walking along, joyfully
carrying the Magic Fan on his shoulder. Now Sun had forgotten to ask
how to make it small, like an apricot leaf, as it was at first. The
Ox-demon changed himself into the form of Pa-chieh, and going up to
Sun he said: "Brother Sun, I am glad to see you back; I hope you have
succeeded." "Yes," replied Sun, and described his fights, and how he
had tricked the Ox-demon's wife into giving him the Fan. The seeming
Pa-chieh said: "You must be very tired after all your efforts; let
me carry the Magic Fan for you." As soon as he had got possession of
it he appeared in his true form, and tried to use it to blow Sun away
84,000 _li_, for he did not know that the Great Holy One had swallowed
a wind-resisting pill, and was therefore immovable. He then put the
Magic Fan in his mouth and fought with his two swords. He was a match
for Sun in all the magic arts, but through the aid of Pa-chieh and
the help of the local gods sent by the Master the Monkey was able
to prevail against him. The Ox-demon changed himself many times into
a number of birds, but for each of these Sun changed himself into a
swifter and stronger one. The Ox-demon then changed himself into many
beasts, such as tigers, leopards, bears, elephants, and an ox 10,000
feet long. He then said to Sun, with a laugh: "What can you do to me
now?" Sun seized his rod of iron, and cried: "Grow!" He immediately
became 100,000 feet high, with eyes like the sun and moon. They fought
till the heavens and the earth shook with their onslaughts.
