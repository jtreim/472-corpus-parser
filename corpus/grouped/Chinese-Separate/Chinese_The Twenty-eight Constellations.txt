The Twenty-eight Constellations








Sacrifices were offered to these spirits by the Emperor on the marble
altar of the Temple of Heaven, and by the high officials throughout
the provinces. Of the twenty-eight the following are regarded as
propitious--namely, the Horned, Room, Tail, Sieve, Bushel, House,
Wall, Mound, Stomach, End, Bristling, Well, Drawn-bow, and Revolving
Constellations; the Neck, Bottom, Heart, Cow, Female, Empty, Danger,
Astride, Cock, Mixed, Demon, Willow, Star, Wing, are unpropitious.

The twenty-eight constellations seem to have become the abodes of gods
as a result of the defeat of a Taoist Patriarch T'ung-t'ien Chiao-chu,
who had espoused the cause of the tyrant Chou, when he and all his
followers were slaughtered by the heavenly hosts in the terrible
catastrophe known as the Battle of the Ten Thousand Immortals. Chiang
Tzu-ya as a reward conferred on them the appanage of the twenty-eight
constellations. The five planets, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and
Saturn, are also the abodes of stellar divinities, called the White,
Green, Black, Red, and Yellow Rulers respectively. Stars good and
bad are all likewise inhabited by gods or demons.
