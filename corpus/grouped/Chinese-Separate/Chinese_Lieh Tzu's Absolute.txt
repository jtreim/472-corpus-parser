Lieh Tzu's Absolute








Lieh Tzu (said to have lived in the fifth century B.C.), one
of the brightest stars in the Taoist constellation, considered
this nameable world as having evolved from an unnameable absolute
being. The evolution did not take place through the direction of
a personal will working out a plan of creation: "In the beginning
there was Chaos . It was a mingled potentiality of Form
, Pneuma , and Substance . A Great Change
 took place in it, and there was a Great Starting _t'ai
ch'u_ which is the beginning of Form. The Great Starting evolved a
Great Beginning , which is the inception of Pneuma. The
Great Beginning was followed by the Great Blank , which
is the first formation of Substance. Substance, Pneuma, and Form
being all evolved out of the primordial chaotic mass, this material
world as it lies before us came into existence." And that which
made it possible for Chaos to evolve was the Solitary Indeterminate
(_i tu_ or the _tao_), which is not created, but is able to create
everlastingly. And being both Solitary and Indeterminate it tells us
nothing determinate about itself.
