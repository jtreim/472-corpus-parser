The Generals Tricked








Sun thought that as the Demon had played a trick on Pa-chieh, he
would play one on his generals. So he hurried on in front of them,
and changed himself into the form of King Ox-head. The Demon and
his generals were invited into his presence, and Red Child said:
"If anyone eats of the pilgrim's flesh, his life will be prolonged
indefinitely. Now he is caught and I invite you to feast on him." Sun,
personifying the father, said: "No, I cannot come. I am fasting
to-day. Moreover, Sun has charge of the pilgrim, and if any harm befall
him it will be the worse for you, for he has seventy-two magic arts. He
can make himself so big that your cave cannot contain him, and he
can make himself as small as a fly, a mosquito, a bee, or a butterfly."

Sun then went to Kuan Yin and appealed for help. She gave him a
bottle, but he found he could not move it. "No," said Kuan Yin,
"for all the forces of the ocean are stored in it."

Kuan Yin lifted it with ease, and said: "This dew water is different
from dragon water, and can extinguish the fire of passion. I will
send a fairy with you on your boat. You need no sails. The fairy
needs only to blow a little, and the boat moves along without any
effort." Finally, the Red Child, having been overcome, repented and
begged to be received as a disciple. Kuan Yin received him and blessed
him, giving him the name of Steward.
