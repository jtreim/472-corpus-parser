Astrological Superstitions








According to Chinese ideas, the sun, moon, and planets influence
sublunary events, especially the life and death of human beings, and
changes in their colour menace approaching calamities. Alterations
in the appearance of the sun announce misfortunes to the State or its
head, as revolts, famines, or the death of the emperor; when the moon
waxes red, or turns pale, men should be in awe of the unlucky times
thus fore-omened.

The sun is symbolized by the figure of a raven in a circle, and
the moon by a hare on its hind-legs pounding rice in a mortar, or
by a three-legged toad. The last refers to the legend of Ch'ang O,
detailed later. The moon is a special object of worship in autumn,
and moon-cakes dedicated to it are sold at this season. All the
stars are ranged into constellations, and an emperor is installed
over them, who resides at the North Pole; five monarchs also live
in the five stars in Leo, where is a palace called Wu Ti Tso, or
'Throne of the Five Emperors.' In this celestial government there are
also an heir-apparent, empresses, sons and daughters, and tribunals,
and the constellations receive the names of men, animals, and other
terrestrial objects. The Great Bear, or Dipper, is worshipped as the
residence of the Fates, where the duration of life and other events
relating to mankind are measured and meted out. Fears are excited by
unusual phenomena among the heavenly bodies.

Both the sun and the moon are worshipped by the Government in
appropriate temples on the east and west sides of Peking.
