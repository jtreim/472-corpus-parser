Star-worship








The star-deities are adored by parents on behalf of their children;
they control courtship and marriage, bring prosperity or adversity in
business, send pestilence and war, regulate rainfall and drought, and
command angels and demons; so every event in life is determined by the
'star-ruler' who at that time from the shining firmament manages the
destinies of men and nations. The worship is performed in the native
homes either by astrologers engaged for that purpose or by Taoist
priests. In times of sickness, ten paper star-gods are arranged,
five good on one side and five bad on the other; a feast is placed
before them, and it is supposed that when the bad have eaten enough
they will take their flight to the south-west; the propitiation of
the good star-gods is in the hope that they will expel the evil stars,
and happiness thus be obtained.

The practical effect of this worship is seen in the following
examples taken from the Chinese list of one hundred and twenty-nine
lucky and unlucky stars, which, with the sixty cycle-stars and the
twenty-eight constellations, besides a vast multitude of others, make
up the celestial galaxy worshipped by China's millions: the Orphan
Star enables a woman to become a man; the Star of Pleasure decides
on betrothals, binding the feet of those destined to be lovers with
silver cords; the Bonepiercing Star produces rheumatism; the Morning
Star, if not worshipped, kills the father or mother during the year;
the Balustrade Star promotes lawsuits; the Three-corpse Star controls
suicide, the Peach-blossom Star lunacy; and so on.
