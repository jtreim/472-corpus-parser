Protectors of the People








Besides the gods who hold definite official posts in these various
Ministries, there are a very large number who are also protecting
patrons of the people; and, though _ex officio_, in many cases quite
as popular and powerful, if not more so. Among the most important
are the following: She-chi, Gods of the Soil and Crops; Shen Nung,
God of Agriculture; Hou-t'u, Earth-mother; Ch'eng-huang, City-god;
T'u-ti, Local Gods; Tsao Chuen, Kitchen-god; T'ien-hou and An-kung,
Goddess and God of Sailors; Ts'an Nue, Goddess of Silkworms; Pa-ch'a,
God of Grasshoppers; Fu Shen, Ts'ai Shen, and Shou Hsing, Gods of
Happiness, Wealth, and Longevity; Men Shen, Door-gods; and She-mo Wang,
etc., the Gods of Serpents.
