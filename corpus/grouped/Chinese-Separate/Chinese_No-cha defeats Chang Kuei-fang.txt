No-cha defeats Chang Kuei-fang








The redoubtable No-cha having, by means of his Heaven-and-earth
Bracelet, vanquished Feng Lin, a star-god and subordinate officer of
Chang Kuei-fang, in spite of the black smoke-clouds which he blew
out of his nostrils, the defeated warrior fled and sought the aid
of his chief, who fought No-cha in some thirty to forty encounters
without succeeding in dislodging him from his Wind-fire Wheel,
which enabled him to move about rapidly and to perform prodigious
feats, such as causing hosts of silver flying dragons like clouds of
snow to descend upon his enemy. During one of these fights No-cha
heard his name called three times, but paid no heed. Finally, with
his Heaven-and-earth Bracelet he broke Chang Kuei-fang's left arm,
following this up by shooting out some dazzling rays of light which
knocked him off his horse.

When he returned to the city to report his victory to Tzu-ya,
the latter asked him if during the battle Kuei-fang had called
his name. "Yes," replied No-cha, "he called, but I took no heed
of him." "When Kuei-fang calls," said Tzu-ya, "the _hun_ and the
_p'o_  become separated, and so the body
falls apart." "But," replied No-cha, "I had changed myself into a
lotus-flower, which has neither _hun_ nor _p'o_, so he could not
succeed in getting me off my magic wheel."
