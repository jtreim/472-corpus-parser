The Magic Gourd








Sun went to meet the Demons, and in conversation learnt from them that
they were on their way to catch the famous Monkey, and that the magic
gourd and vase were for that purpose. They showed these treasures to
him, and explained that the gourd, though small, could hold a thousand
people. "That is nothing," replied Sun. "I have a gourd which can
contain all the heavens." At this they marvelled greatly, and made a
bargain with him, according to which he was to give them his gourd,
after it had been tested as to its capacity to contain the heavens,
in exchange for their precious gourd and vase. Going up to Heaven,
the Monkey obtained permission to extinguish the light of the sun,
moon, and stars for one hour. At noon the next day there was complete
darkness, and the Demons believed Sun when he stated that he had put
the whole heavens into his gourd so that there could be no light. They
then handed over to the Monkey their magic gourd and vase, and in
exchange he gave them his false gourd.
