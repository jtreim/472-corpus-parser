Double Immortality








Having made minute observations on the secret properties of the
peaches, Sun ate of them and was thus assured against death. The
time was ripe for him to indulge in his tricks without restraint,
and an opportunity soon presented itself. Deeply hurt at not having
been invited to the feast of the Peach Festival, P'an-t'ao Hui, given
periodically to the Immortals by Wang-mu Niang-niang, the Goddess of
the Immortals, he resolved upon revenge. When the preparations for the
feast were complete he cast a spell over the servants, causing them
to fall into a deep sleep, and then ate up all the most juicy meats
and drank the fine wines provided for the heavenly guests. Sun had,
however, indulged himself too liberally; with heavy head and bleary
eye he missed the road back to his heavenly abode, and came unaware
to the gate of Lao Chuen, who was, however, absent from his palace. It
was only a matter of a few minutes for Sun to enter and swallow the
pills of immortality which Lao Chuen kept in five gourds. Thus Sun,
doubly immortal, riding on the mist, again descended to Hua-kuo Shan.
