The Soaring Head








Shen Kung-pao then doffed his Taoist cap, seized his sword, with his
left hand firmly grasped the blue thread binding his hair, and with
his right cut off his head. His body did not fall down. He then took
his head and threw it up into space. Tzu-ya gazed with upturned face
as it continued to rise, and was sorely puzzled. But the Ancient
Immortal of the South Pole had kept a watch on the proceedings. He
said: "Tzu-ya is a loyal and honest man; it looks as if he has been
deceived by this charlatan." He ordered White Crane Youth to assume
quickly the form of a crane and fetch Shen Kung-pao's head.
