The Spiders and the Extinguisher








When they had gone a short distance they perceived a great building of
fine architecture ahead of them. It proved to be a Taoist temple. Sha
Ho-shang said: "Let us enter, for Buddhism and Taoism teach the
same things. They differ only in their vestments." The Taoist abbot
received them with civility and ordered five cups of tea. Now he was
in league with the seven women, and when the servant had made the tea
they put poison in each cup. Sun, however, suspected a conspiracy,
and did not drink his tea. Seeing that the rest had been poisoned, he
went and attacked the sisters, who transformed themselves into huge
spiders. They were able to spin ropes instead of webs with which to
bind their enemies. But Sun attacked and killed them all.

The Taoist abbot then showed himself in his true form, a demon with
a thousand eyes. He joined battle with Sun, and a terrible contest
ensued, the result being that the Demon succeeded in putting an
extinguisher on his enemy. This was a new trick which Sun did not
understand. However, after trying in vain to break out through the
top and sides, he began to bore downward, and, finding that the
extinguisher was not deep in the ground, he succeeded in effecting
his escape from below. But he feared that his Master and the others
would die of the poison. At this juncture, while he was suffering
mental tortures on their behalf, a Bodhisattva, Lady Pi Lan, came
to his rescue. By the aid of her magic he broke the extinguisher,
gave his Master and fellow-disciples pills to counteract the poison,
and so rescued them.
