Conditions of Release








Thus subdued, Sun would not have been able to get out of his stone
prison but for the intercession of Kuan Yin P'u-sa, who obtained
his release on his solemn promise that he would serve as guide,
philosopher, and friend to Hsuean Chuang, the priest who was to
undertake the difficult journey of 108,000 _li_ to the Western
Heaven. This promise, on the whole, he fulfilled in the service
of Hsuean Chuang during the fourteen years of the long journey. Now
faithful, now restive and undisciplined, he was always the one to
triumph in the end over the eighty-one fantastical tribulations which
beset them as they journeyed.
