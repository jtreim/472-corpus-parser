The Armless People








In the Mountains of the Sun and Moon, which are in the Centre of the
Great Waste, are the people who have no arms, but whose legs instead
grow out of their shoulders. They pick flowers with their toes. They
bow by raising the body horizontal with the shoulders, thus turning
the face to the ground.
