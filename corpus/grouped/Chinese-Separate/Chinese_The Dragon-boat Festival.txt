The Dragon-boat Festival








This is said to be the origin of the dragon-boats which are to be
seen on all the waterways of China on the fifth day of the fifth
moon.  The Festival of the Dragon-boats, held on that day, was
instituted in memory of the statesman-poet Ch'ue Yuean (332-296 B.C.),
who drowned himself in the Mi-lo River, an affluent of the Tung-t'ing
Lake, after having been falsely accused by one of the petty princes
of the State. The people, out of pity for the unfortunate courtier,
sent out these boats in search of his body.
