Sha Ho-shang becomes Baggage-coolie








When Kuan Yin passed through that region on her way to China to find
the priest who was predestined to devote himself to the laborious
undertaking of the quest of the sacred Buddhist books, Sha Ho-shang
threw himself on his knees before her and begged her to put an end
to all his woes.

The goddess promised that he should be delivered by the priest,
her envoy, provided he would engage himself in the service of the
pilgrim. On his promising to do this, and to lead a better life,
she herself ordained him priest. In the end it came about that Hsuean
Chuang, when passing the Sha Ho, took him into his suite as coolie
to carry his baggage. Yue Huang pardoned him in consideration of the
service he was rendering to the Buddhist cause.
