The Spider and the Fly




Mr. Spider wanted to marry Miss Fly. Many times he told her of his
love and begged her to become his wife, but she always refused for
she did not like him.

One day when she saw Mr. Spider coming again Miss Fly closed all
the doors and windows of her house and made ready a pot of boiling
water. Then she waited, and when Mr. Spider called, begging her
to allow him to enter, she answered by throwing boiling water at
him. This made Mr. Spider very angry and he cried:

"I will never forgive you for this, but I and my descendants will
always despise you. We will never give you any peace."

Mr. Spider kept his word, and even today one can see the hatred of
the spider for the fly.
