"EATING UP THE PROTECTOR" 




In the country of Uttara there lived a Brahmin named Kusalanatha,
who had a wife and six sons. All lived in a state of prosperity for
some time, but the entrance of Saturn into the Brahmin's horoscope
turned everything upside down. The once prosperous Brahmin became poor,
and was reduced to go to the neighbouring woods to gather bamboo rice
with which to feed his hungry family. 

One day while plucking the bamboo ears, he saw a bush close by
in flames, in the midst of which was a serpent struggling for its
life. The Brahmin at once ran to its rescue, and stretching towards
it a long green stick the reptile crept on to it and escaped from the
flames, and then spread its hood and with a hissing sound approached
to sting its rescuer. The Brahmin began to weep and bewail his folly in
having saved the ungrateful creature, at which the serpent asked him:--

"O Brahmin, why do you weep?"

Said the old man: "You now purpose to kill me; is this the reward
for my having saved your life?"

"True, you have rescued me from a terrible death, but how am I to
appease my hunger?" replied the serpent.

And quoth the Brahmin, "You speak of your hunger, but who is to feed
my old wife and six hungry children at my house?"

The serpent, seeing the anxiety of the Brahmin, emitted a precious
gem from its hood, and bade him take it home and give it to his
wife for household expenses, after which to return to the wood to be
devoured. The old man agreed, and, solemnly promising to return without
fail, went home. Having given the gem to his family, and told them
of his pact with the serpent, the Brahmin went back to the wood. The
serpent had meanwhile reflected upon its own base ingratitude.

"Is it right," said it to itself, "to kill him who saved me from the
flames? No! I shall rather perish of hunger, if I cannot find a prey
to-day, than slay my protector."

So when the old Brahmin appeared, true to his word, the serpent
presented him with another valuable gem, and after expressing a wish
that he should live long and happily with his wife and children,
went its own way, while the Brahmin returned joyously to his home.

"Even as the serpent purposed acting towards its benefactor," continued
the king, "so did I, in my rage, intend putting to death my faithful
minister and the protector of my life, Bodhaditya; and to free myself
from this grievous sin there is no penance I should not undergo."

Then king Alakesa ordered a thousand Brahmins to be fed every day
during his life, and many rich gifts to be distributed in temples as
atonement for his great error. And from that day Bodhaditya and his
three colleagues enjoyed still more of the royal favour. With those
four faithful ministers king Alakesa lived a most happy life and had
a most prosperous reign.

May there be prosperity to all!
