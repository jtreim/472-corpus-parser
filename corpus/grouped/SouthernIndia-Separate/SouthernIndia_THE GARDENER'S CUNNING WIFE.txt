THE GARDENER'S CUNNING WIFE




In a certain village there lived with his wife a poor gardener who
cultivated greens in a small patch in the backyard of his house. They
were in thirty little beds, half of which he would water every
day. This occupied him from the fifth to the fifteenth ghatika.

His wife used to cut a basketful of greens every evening, and he
took them in the mornings to sell in the village. The sale brought
him a measure or two of rice, and on this the family lived! If he
could manage any extra work of an evening he got a few coppers which
served to meet their other expenses.

Now in that village there was a temple to Kali, before which was a
fine tank with a mango tree on its bank. The fish in the tank and the
mangoes from the tree were dedicated to the goddess, and were strictly
forbidden to the villagers. If any one was discovered cutting a mango
or catching a fish, he was at once excommunicated from the village. So
strict was the prohibition.

The gardener was returning home one morning after selling his
greens and passed the temple. The mangoes, so carefully guarded by
religious protection, were hanging on the tree in great numbers,
and the gardener's eyes fell on them! His mouth watered. He looked
round about him, and fortunately there was no one by, at least, as
far as his eyes could reach. So he hastily plucked one of the mangoes
and with nimble feet descended into the tank to wash it. Just then
a most charming shoal of fish met his eyes. These protected dwellers
in the tank had no notion of danger, and so were frolicking about at
their ease. The gardener looked about him first and finding no one
by caught half a dozen stout fish at one plunge of his hand. He hid
them and the mango underneath the rice in his basket and returned
home, happy in the thought that he had not been caught. Now he had
a special delight in fish, and when he reached his house he showed
what he brought to his wife and asked her to prepare a dish with the
newly caught fish and the never-till-then tasted mango.

Meanwhile he had to water his garden, and went to the backyard for
the purpose. The watering was done by a pikota. He used to run up
and down the pole while a friend of his, the son of his neighbour,
lifted the water and irrigated the garden.

Meanwhile his wife cooked the dish of mango and fish in a pan, and
found the flavour so sweet that even while the fish was only half
cooked she began to taste one bit of it after another till more than
half had already gone down her throat! The dish was at last cooked,
and the few remaining slices in the pan were taken off the fire, so
she went into the verandah and from thence saw her husband running up
and down the pikota. She beckoned to him that the dish was ready and
that he should come in and taste it. However, he never noticed her,
but kept on running up and down the pikota, and while running up
and down he was obliged to wave his hands about, and this his wife
mistook as an indication that she might eat up her portion of the
dish. At any rate her imagination made her think so; and she went in
and ate a slice, and then went out into the verandah again to call
her husband who was still running up and down the pikota. Again, her
husband, so she thought, waved his hands in permission to go on with
her dinner. Again she went in and had another slice. Thus it went on
for a full ghatika till the last slice was consumed.

"Alas!" thought she, "With what great eagerness my husband fetched
the fish and the mango, and how sadly, out of greediness, have I
disappointed him. Surely his anger will know no bounds when he comes
in. I must soon devise some means to save myself."

So she brought the pan in which she cooked the fish and mango out
of the house and covered it with another pan of similar size and
sat down before it. Then she undid her hair and twisted it about
her head until it was dishevelled. She then began to make a great
noise. This action by a woman in an illiterate family of low caste is
always supposed to indicate a visitation from a goddess and a demon;
so when her husband from the pikota tree saw the state of his wife,
his guilty conscience smote him. The change in his wife alarmed him,
and he came down suddenly and stood before her. As soon as she saw
him she roared out at him:--

"Why have you injured me to-day by plundering my mango and fish? How
dare you do such an irreligious act? You shall soon see the results
of your impertinence!"

"The goddess has come upon my wife most terribly," thought the poor
man. "Her divine power may soon kill her! What shall I do?"

So he fell at the feet of the divine visitation as he thought it to
be, and said:--

"My most holy goddess, your dog of a servant has this day deviated
from the straight path. Excuse him this time, and he will never do
so a second time."

"Run then with the pan which contains the fruits of your robbery and
dip it deep into my tank. Then shall the fish become alive and the
mango shall take its place in the tree."

The gardener received the order most submissively, and taking the
pan in his hand flew to the tank. There he dipped it in the water
and came back to his house fully believing that his sin that day had
been forgiven, and that the cooked fish had become alive again and
the mango a living one. Thus did the cunning wife save herself from
her husband's wrath!
