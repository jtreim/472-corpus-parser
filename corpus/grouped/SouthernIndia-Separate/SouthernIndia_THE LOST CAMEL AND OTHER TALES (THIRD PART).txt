THE LOST CAMEL AND OTHER TALES (THIRD PART)




At the end of the third watch of the night, Bodhavyapaka, the Third
Minister of king Alakesa, went to see whether the royal bedchamber
was properly guarded, and the king, summoning him to his presence,
told him of the First Minister's crime, upon which Bodhavyapaka,
after making due obeisance, thus spake:--

"Most noble king, such a grave crime should be severely punished,
but it behoves us not to act before having ascertained that he is
guilty beyond doubt, for evil are the consequences of precipitation,
in proof of which I know a story which I will relate, with your
Majesty's leave."
