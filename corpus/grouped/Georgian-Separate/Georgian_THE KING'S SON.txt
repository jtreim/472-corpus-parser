THE KING'S SON


A certain king had a son, and sent him out to be nursed by a smith's
wife. This crafty woman put the king's child in a common cradle,
and her own son in the gorgeous royal cradle. Some years afterwards,
the king took the changeling to court, and brought his foster-brother
with him. One fine day, the king set out for his favourite forest
to hunt, and took his pretended son with him. When they arrived,
the king asked: 'How do you like this place, my son? Is it not a
magnificent wood?' The boy replied: 'O father, if we could only burn
it all somehow, what a fine lot of charcoal we should have!'

Then the king sent for the other boy, and asked him the same
question. 'There could not be a better forest, your Majesty!' 'But what
would you do with it if it were yours?' 'Nothing, your Majesty. I would
double the guards, so that it should not be injured.' Then the king
saw how the smith's wife had tried to cheat him, and put her in prison.
