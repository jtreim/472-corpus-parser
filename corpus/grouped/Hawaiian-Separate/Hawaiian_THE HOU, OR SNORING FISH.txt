THE HOU, OR SNORING FISH


The hou lives in shallow water. When fishing with torches on a
quiet, still night, if one gets close to where it is sleeping it
will be heard to snore as if it were a human being. This is a small,
beautifully colored fish. Certain sharks also, sleeping in shallow
water, can be heard at times indulging in the same habit.
