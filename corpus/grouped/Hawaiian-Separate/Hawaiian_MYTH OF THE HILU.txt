MYTH OF THE HILU


The hilu is said to have once possessed a human form, but by some
strange event its body was changed to that of a fish. No knowledge of
its ancestry or place of origin is given, but the story is as follows:

Hilu-ula and Hilu-uli were born twins, one a male and the other a
female. They had human form, but with power to assume that of the fish
now known as hilu. The two children grew up together and in due time
when Hilu-uli, the sister, was grown up, she left her brother and
parents without saying a word and went into the sea, and, assuming
her fish form, set out on a journey, eventually reaching Heeia,
Koolaupoko. During the time of her journey she increased the numbers
of the hilu so that by the time they came close to Heeia there was so
large a school that the sea was red with them. When the people of Heeia
and Kaneohe saw this, they paddled out in their canoes to discover
that it was a fish they had never seen nor heard of before. Returning
to the shore for nets, they surrounded the school and drew in so many
that they were not able to care for them in their canoes. The fishes
multiplied so rapidly that when the first school was surrounded and
dragged ashore, another one appeared, and so on, till the people were
surfeited. Yet the fish stayed in the locality, circling around. The
people ate of them in all styles known to Hawaiians; raw, lawalued,
salted, and broiled over a fire of coals.

While the Koolau people were thus fishing and feasting, Hilu-ula,
the brother, arrived among them in his human form; and when he saw
the hilu-uli broiling over the coal fire he recognized the fish form
of his sister. This so angered him that he assumed the form of a
whirlwind and entered every house where they had hilu and blew the
fish all back into the sea. Since then the hilu-uli has dark scales,
and is well known all over the islands.
