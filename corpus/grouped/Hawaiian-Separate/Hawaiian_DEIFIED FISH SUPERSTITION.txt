DEIFIED FISH SUPERSTITION


Some of the varieties of fish we now eat were deified and prayed to
by the people of the olden time, and even some Hawaiians of to-day
labor under like superstition with regard to sharks, eels, octopus,
and some others. They are afraid to eat or touch these lest they
suffer in consequence; and this belief has been perpetuated, handed
down from parents to children, even to the present day. The writer
was one of those brought up to this belief, and only lately has eaten
the kapu fish of his ancestors without fearing a penalty therefore.
