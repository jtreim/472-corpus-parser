THE PERJURER


On the Kummersee, which is also called Hindersee, in the Tyrol, the
parish of Schoenna possesses two beautiful mountains which they had
only hired in former times from the villagers of Passeir. But at last
the inhabitants of Schoenna affirmed that they were their own property,
and therefore commenced a law-suit which was to be decided by oath.
A man of Schoenna committed perjury, which he thought to do safely in
the following manner. He stuck in his hat a ladle called in the Tyrol
schoepfer, which is also the German word for Creator, and put in his
shoes some earth out of his own field. So he appeared on the Alp before
the judges and swore: "As truly as I have the Schoepfer above me and my
own earth beneath me, the two Alps belong to Schoenna." In consequence
of that oath they were awarded to the villagers of Schoenna by the
judges.

But at the same moment the devil flew down the precipices, seized the
perjurer by his neck, and dragged him straight off to hell, leaving
behind him as he rushed through the air a dreadful smell of sulphur
and a train of fire. With his prey he beat an enormous hole through
the Weisse Wand, a huge mountain close to the Kummersee, which hole is
still to be seen up to the present day as a warning. From thence he
flew over the Christl Alp down to the village of St. Martin, where he
rested himself upon a stone, and then dragged the body through the mud
of the village streets, and as he passed, the devil is said to have
grunted, "For there is nothing so weighty as a perjurer's body."
