THE GOLD-WORM OF THE ALPBACH VALLEY


Near the "Reichen-Felder" (rich fields), behind the valley of Alpbach,
is often to be seen, especially on the eve of holy-days, a gold-worm of
wonderful brilliancy, which lies there motionless, and wrinkled in such
a manner that it looks like a golden chain.

Sometimes this gold-worm has also been seen down in the valley far
beneath the Reichen-Felder, even once so far as the banks of the
Alpbach, on a spot which is called G'reit. Several times daring people
approached the worm, but when they had come near to him they were
struck with an uncontrollable terror; and on running to fetch others as
witnesses, on their return the worm was no longer to be seen.

The peasants round about say, "Those people had not the grace of
putting something sacred upon the worm, and for that reason it
disappeared." After all, it is not stated what the worm is, whether it
is a treasure-bloom, or a treasure-guardian, of which there are numbers
in this rich gold country.
