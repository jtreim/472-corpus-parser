KADDYâ€™S LUCK




There was a tall young woman whom the fairies used to visit, coming
through the keyhole at night. She could hear them dancing and singing in
her room, but in the morning they used to go the way they had come, only
they always left her some money.

When she got married she chose a tall husband like herself, and they had
a fine big child.

One night they went to a fair, and they got to one side to hear the
fairies; for some people could tell when the fairies were coming, for
they made a noise like the wind. Whilst they were waiting she told her
husband how the fairies used to leave her money at night.

When they got home they found their baby all right, and went to bed. But
next morning the young mother found her child had been changed in the
night, and there was a very little baby in the cradle. And the child
never grew big, for the fairies had changed her child for spite.
