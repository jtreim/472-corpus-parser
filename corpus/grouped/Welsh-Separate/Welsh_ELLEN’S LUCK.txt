ELLENâ€™S LUCK




Ellen was a good girl, and beautiful to look upon. One Sunday she was
walking by an open gutter in a town in North Wales when she found a
copper. After that day Ellen walked every Sunday afternoon by the same
drain, and always found a copper. She was a careful girl, and used to
hoard her money.

One day her old mother found her pile of pennies, and wished to know
where she got them.

Ellen told her, but though she walked by the gutter for many a Sunday
after, she never found another copper.
