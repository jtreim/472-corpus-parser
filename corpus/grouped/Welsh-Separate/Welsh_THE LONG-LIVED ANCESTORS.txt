THE LONG-LIVED ANCESTORS




The Eagle of Gwernabwy had been long married to his female, and had by
her many children; she died, and he continued a long time a widower; but
at length be proposed a marriage with the Owl of Cwm Cwmlwyd; but afraid
of her being young, so as to have children by her, and thereby degrade
his own family, he first of all went to inquire about her age amongst
the aged of the world. Accordingly he applied to the Stag of Rhedynfre,
whom he found lying close to the trunk of an old oak, and requested to
know the Owl’s age.

“I have seen,” said the Stag, “this oak an acorn, which is now fallen
to the ground through age, without either bark or leaves, and never
suffered any hurt or strain except from my rubbing myself against it
once a day, after getting up on my legs; but I never remember to have
seen the Owl you mention younger or older than she seems to be at
this day. But there is one older than I am, and that is the Salmon of
Glynllifon.”

The Eagle then applied to the Salmon for the age of the Owl. The Salmon
answered, “I am as many years old as there are scales upon my skin, and
particles of spawn within my belly; yet never saw I the Owl you mention
but the same in appearance. But there is one older than I am, and that
is the Blackbird of Cilgwri.”

The Eagle next repaired to the Blackbird of Cilgwri, whom he found
perched upon a small stone, and enquired of him the Owl’s age.

“Dost thou see this stone upon which I sit,” said the Blackbird, “which
is now no bigger than what a man can carry in his hand? I have seen this
very stone of such weight as to be a sufficient load for a hundred oxen
to draw, which has suffered neither rubbing nor wearing, save that I rub
my bill on it once every evening, and touch the tips of my wings on it
every morning, when I expand them to fly; yet I have not seen the Owl
either older or younger than she appears to be at this day. But there is
one older than I am, and that is the Frog of Mochno Bog, and if he does
not know her age, there is not a creature living that does know it.”

The Eagle went last of all to the Frog and desired to know the Owl’s
age. He answered, “I never ate anything but the dust from the spot which
I inhabit, and that very sparingly, and dost thou see these great hills
that surround and overawe this bog where I lie? They are formed only
of the excrements from my body since I have inhabited this place, yet I
never remember to have seen the Owl but an old hag, making that
hideous noise, Too, hoo, hoo! always frightening the children in the
neighbourhood.”

So the Eagle of Gwernabwy, the Stag of Rhedynfre, the Salmon of
Glynllifon, the Blackbird of Cilgwri, the Frog of Mochno Bog, and the
Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd are the oldest creatures in the whole world!
