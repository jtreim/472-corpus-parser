THE COCK, THE CUCKOO, AND THE BLACK-COCK



This is another of those tales in which the birds' notes must be
imitated.

Once on a time the Cock, the Cuckoo, and the Black-cock bought a cow
between them. But when they came to share it, and couldn't agree
which should buy the others out, they settled that he who woke first
in the morning should have the cow.

So the Cock woke first.

  Now the cow's mine!
  Now the cow's mine!
  Hurrah! hurrah!

he crew, and as he crew, up awoke the Cuckoo.

  Half cow!
  Half cow!

sang the Cuckoo, and woke up the Black-cock.

  A like share, a like share;
  Dear friends, that's only fair!
  Saw see! See saw!

That's what the Black-cock said.

And now, can you tell me which of them ought to have the cow?
